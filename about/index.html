<h1>About</h1>

<p>I grew up in Cleveland, the oldest of four boys and the biggest little fan of <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/2015/10/1995_cleveland_indians_hold_th.html">the 1995 baseball team</a> and LeBron James&rsquo; ascendance. Then I went across the country to Pomona College, where I studied economics and math, first performed improv for paying audiences, and got ankle tattoos.</p>

<p>My immediate plans after college fell apart, well, immediately, so I cold applied to a couple jobs and took a customer service role at Facebook. After a brief stint answering angry questions and taking nudes off the site, I moved to the Platform Policy team, where we <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/whopper-sacrifice-de-friended-on-facebook/">shut down apps</a> when they were bad. Then I went to Twitter to start and manage their API Policy team. It was mostly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/18/twitter-twifficiency/">more of the same</a>, though we also helped developers build better apps when we could. And that&rsquo;s where I honed a passion for user experience &ndash; whether on apps that I work on directly, or helping people better understand the apps and other products they use. Ultimately though, Silicon Valley was not for me.</p>

<p>I moved to North Carolina for my second career, which was helping <a href="https://knowme.works">Know Me</a> conceive, create, and launch their apps. There were also weekends and summers presenting youth programs at a science museum, and countless nights teaching and performing improv, sketch, and standup at DSI. We were good enough to make the <a href="https://delclosemarathon.com">Del Close Marathon</a> a bunch of years in a row, and that was always fun. So I owe it a lot, and wasn&rsquo;t there at the very end, but if you know you know. In between all this I took two sabbaticals to ride a skateboard down the eastern seaboard.</p>

<p>Then I moved to Florida to be closer to family. I wrapped up my work with Know Me after a major overhaul of their flagship app, and got into the local improv scene. By day, I do contract tech work remotely for small businesses and in-home IT support for the vast network of retired Florida folks. By nights and weekends, I perform with <a href="https://www.actorsrep.org">Actor&rsquo;s Rep</a> or <a href="https://theimprovu.com">Improv U</a>. I snuck in a few classes from the Burt Reynolds Institute before he passed away, even though he never showed up. And I led an improv workshop at the 2018 i3 BUILD Summit at Pitt &ndash; never invited back!</p>
