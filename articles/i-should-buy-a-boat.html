<h1>I Should Buy A Boat</h1>

<p>I was a trains kid when I was little, specifically Thomas the Tank Engine. My parents would record episodes of Shining Time Station to those brick-sized videotapes so we could watch them whenever we wanted, and I would fast forward the parts with the real people to get to the trains. We had wooden Brio train sets, complete with ramps and tunnels and merges and a little shed where the trains could go to sleep at the end of the day. The Thomas-branded Brio trains were in an uncanny valley where they didn&rsquo;t look quite like the trains from the show, so I preferred the faceless generic engines.</p>

<p>When I think about it, the appeal of trains was the tracks. Trains couldn&rsquo;t go just anywhere they wanted, which made them neat little storytelling devices. You could lay out the story in parallel with the tracks. Everything on the Island of Sodor had a predefined place, and the stories fit within them. The same went for playing with the wooden trains and tracks. The paradox of choice wasn&rsquo;t present in my childhood imagination (unsure if this was a good thing or a bad thing) because I was limited to the tracks we had when playing with trains. Sure, there were still hundreds of possible track layouts with those pieces, but it wasn&rsquo;t infinite, which was probably daunting in some invisible back-of-the-mind way.</p>

<p>I was (still am) a big computer nerd when I was little. My after-school time was a mix of playing games and &ldquo;making&rdquo; games, where the making was either re-skinning existing games in ResEdit or creating tiny black and white point and click adventures in HyperCard. The equivalent of today&rsquo;s AAA game back then was anything that came in a box from a store, as opposed to being a download from AOL or a CD that came with a magazine. And the only non-educational boxed game in our house was Myst, so of course it was my favorite.<sup><a href="#fn-2-boat" id="fr-2-boat">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The immediate allure of Myst was walking up to the big rocket ship and checking it out. Space is cool! But the enduring appeal came from a similar restriction as train tracks: the main area of the game is an island, there&rsquo;s only so much you can do. Furthermore, it was a game where timing or dexterity or skill really didn&rsquo;t matter. You could take as long as you want to clumsily work through a puzzle and you couldn&rsquo;t really die or reach game over. This isn&rsquo;t what they were going for, but: it was kind of a laid-back island lifestyle approach to a video game set on an island.</p>

<p>They say you can either be a beach person or a mountains person. I definitely skew more beach than mountains, but it&rsquo;s more about being near the water. Laying out on the sand doesn&rsquo;t really appeal to me. And forget all the planning that goes into a big beach day: packing a cooler, setting up a shade and/or chairs, re-applying sunscreen, there&rsquo;s so much work that goes into relaxing! What really fires my synapses is being on a little island, where the infinite horizon of the sea dwarves your sense of where you are. They also say no man is an island, but I think I would like to be.</p>

<p>And this tracks throughout the my life in the places I&rsquo;ve gone and the places I want to go. The closest thing I have to a bucket list is a loose desire to see the wonders of the world, and the first and only one I&rsquo;ve checked off is Easter Island. I loved that trip. When I drove down the Pacific Coast Highway for the first time, the thing that stood out was Rincon Island &mdash; a tiny manmade island disguising oil wells! Our family would go to my grandpa&rsquo;s place in Jupiter for spring break more or less every year, and even that was technically on a barrier island.</p>

<p>My parents would trade off on the long drive from Cleveland to Jupiter so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to stop overnight anywhere. There was something magical about falling asleep in a car seat somewhere in Virginia and waking up at the Florida state line, to go into the welcome center for a free sample of orange juice. I kind of enjoyed the trip down as much as the week there. (The trip back, not as fun.) But I had to share it with three brothers and two parents, and I want to be an island! So when I was maybe ten years old I infamously told my mom that I would like to pack my backpack and take the bus by myself. That obviously didn&rsquo;t happen, but it did become a tiny bit of lore (&ldquo;remember when you thought you could just ride a bus by yourself as a little kid for 24 hours?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>By far the thing I&rsquo;m proudest of is my <a href="/boardtrip/">skateboard trip</a> from North Carolina to Florida. It wasn&rsquo;t quite Ohio to Florida, but it also wasn&rsquo;t by bus. I was alone with my thoughts and podcasts for a month. I was an island. The first leg ended at my grandpa&rsquo;s place in Jupiter of course, and two years later, I returned to Jupiter and skateboarded from there to Key West. And the four days I spent riding a skateboard down the Overseas Heritage Trail were the best days of my life. Still are. Less than a year later, I packed up my life and moved to Florida.</p>

<p>I moved to Melbourne, a little more than an hour&rsquo;s drive north of Jupiter. I spent a lot of time that year commuting back and forth to see my grandpa and aunt and uncle. Then my grandpa passed away and I moved into the Jupiter place. A &ldquo;five year plan&rdquo; started to take form: I would keep moving south until reaching the keys. I had done Melbourne for a year, was now in Jupiter, would eventually move to West Palm Beach, then Miami, then the keys. Well, I stayed in Jupiter for two years, then when the pandemic brought a lot of people to south Florida including my parents, I got my own place in downtown West Palm. And as five years somehow passed, during which I mentally aged fifteen years and went to Miami a handful of times, I realized I would be miserable there. So I started focusing my nighttime Zillow wish-browsing on the keys. And when a too-good-to-be-true condo showed up in Marathon, I went for it.</p>

<p>Now I live on a little island in a little home by myself. It isn&rsquo;t lonely, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been moving toward my whole life. The keys exist as they are today, where I am able to walk to a grocery store and get whatever food I want despite being over an hour drive from the mainland, because an impossibly rich maniac<sup><a href="#fn-3-boat" id="fr-3-boat">3</a></sup> built train tracks over the ocean a hundred years ago. Those train tracks became the road and bridges that I skateboarded on. This delights the train kid in me more than I can describe. The best <a href="https://www.ci.marathon.fl.us/community/page/old-seven-mile-bridge">bridge</a> in the world for gliding over the infinite ocean, completely safe from cars, is a couple minutes from my front door, so I can relive the best days of my life any sunny day that I want. And most of them are.</p>

<li id="fn-2-boat">The sequel, Riven, took it even further by setting the game on a chain of five islands, and realistic ones at that (primitive houses instead of rocket ships). No surprise, I love that game even more than Myst. <a href="#fr-2-boat">↩︎︎</a></li>

His third wife became a major benefactor to UNC Chapel Hill, where I lived for four years. And his Palm Beach mansion was on my running route for five years. <a href="#fr-3-boat">↩︎︎</a></li>
