<title>I Should Buy A Boat</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/i-should-buy-a-boat.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I was a train kid when I was little, specifically Thomas the Tank Engine. My parents would record episodes of Shining Time Station to those brick-sized videotapes so we could watch them whenever we wanted, and I would fast forward the parts with the real people to get to the trains. We had wooden Brio train sets, complete with ramps and tunnels and merges and a little shed where the trains could go to sleep at the end of the day. The Thomas-branded Brio trains were in an uncanny valley where they didn&rsquo;t look quite like the trains from the show, so I preferred the faceless generic engines.</p>

<p>When I think about it, the appeal of trains was the tracks. Trains couldn&rsquo;t go just anywhere they wanted, which made them neat little storytelling devices. You could lay out the story in parallel with the tracks. Everything on the Island of Sodor had a predefined place, and the stories fit within them. The same went for playing with the wooden trains and tracks. The paradox of choice wasn&rsquo;t present in my childhood imagination (unsure if this was a good thing or a bad thing) because I was limited to the tracks we had when playing with trains. Sure, there were still hundreds of possible track layouts with those pieces, but it wasn&rsquo;t infinite, which was probably daunting in some invisible back-of-the-mind way.</p>

<p>I was (still am) a big computer nerd when I was little. My after-school time was a mix of playing games and &ldquo;making&rdquo; games, where the making was either re-skinning existing games in ResEdit or creating tiny black and white point and click adventures in HyperCard. The equivalent of today&rsquo;s AAA game back then was anything that came in a box from a store, as opposed to being a download from AOL or a CD that came with a magazine. And the only non-educational boxed game in our house was Myst, so of course it was my favorite.<sup><a href="#fn-2-boat" id="fr-2-boat">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The immediate allure of Myst was walking up to the big rocket ship and checking it out. Space is cool! But the enduring appeal came from a similar restriction as train tracks: the main area of the game is an island, there&rsquo;s only so much you can do. Furthermore, it was a game where timing or dexterity or skill really didn&rsquo;t matter. You could take as long as you want to clumsily work through a puzzle and you couldn&rsquo;t really die or reach game over. This isn&rsquo;t what they were going for, but: it was kind of a laid-back island lifestyle approach to a video game set on an island.</p>

<p>They say you can either be a beach person or a mountains person. I definitely skew more beach than mountains, but it&rsquo;s more about being near the water. Laying out on the sand doesn&rsquo;t really appeal to me. And forget all the planning that goes into a big beach day: packing a cooler, setting up a shade and/or chairs, re-applying sunscreen, there&rsquo;s so much work that goes into relaxing! What really fires my synapses is being on a little island, where the infinite horizon of the sea dwarves your sense of where you are. They also say no man is an island, but I think I would like to be.</p>

<p>And this tracks throughout the my life in the places I&rsquo;ve gone and the places I want to go. The closest thing I have to a bucket list is a loose desire to see the wonders of the world, and the first and only one I&rsquo;ve checked off is Easter Island. I loved that trip. When I drove down the Pacific Coast Highway for the first time, the thing that stood out was Rincon Island &mdash; a tiny manmade island disguising oil wells! Our family would go to my grandpa&rsquo;s place in Jupiter for spring break more or less every year, and even that was technically on a barrier island.</p>

<p>My parents would trade off on the long drive from Cleveland to Jupiter so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to stop overnight anywhere. There was something magical about falling asleep in a car seat somewhere in Virginia and waking up at the Florida state line, to go into the welcome center for a free sample of orange juice. I kind of enjoyed the trip down as much as the week there. (The trip back, not as fun.) But I had to share it with three brothers and two parents, and I want to be an island! So when I was maybe ten years old I infamously told my mom that I would like to pack my backpack and take the bus by myself. That obviously didn&rsquo;t happen, but it did become a tiny bit of lore (&ldquo;remember when you thought you could just ride a bus by yourself as a little kid for 24 hours?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>By far the thing I&rsquo;m proudest of is my <a href="/boardtrip/">skateboard trip</a> from North Carolina to Florida. It wasn&rsquo;t quite Ohio to Florida, but it also wasn&rsquo;t by bus. I was alone with my thoughts and podcasts for a month. I was an island. The first leg ended at my grandpa&rsquo;s place in Jupiter of course, and two years later, I returned to Jupiter and skateboarded from there to Key West. And the four days I spent riding a skateboard down the Overseas Heritage Trail were the best days of my life. Still are. Less than a year later, I packed up my life and moved to Florida.</p>

<p>I moved to Melbourne, a little more than an hour drive north of Jupiter. I spent a lot of time that year commuting back and forth to see my grandpa and aunt and uncle. Then my grandpa passed away and I moved into the Jupiter place. A &ldquo;five year plan&rdquo; started to take form: I would keep moving south until reaching the keys. I had done Melbourne for a year, was now in Jupiter, would eventually move to West Palm Beach, then Miami, then the keys. Well, I stayed in Jupiter for two years, then when the pandemic brought a lot of people to south Florida including my parents, I got my own place in downtown West Palm. And as five years somehow passed, during which I mentally aged fifteen years and went to Miami a handful of times, I realized I would be miserable there. So I started focusing my nighttime Zillow wish-browsing on the keys. And when a too-good-to-be-true condo showed up in Marathon, I went for it.</p>

<p>Now I live on a little island in a little home by myself. It isn&rsquo;t lonely, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been moving toward my whole life. The keys exist as they are today, where I am able to walk to a grocery store and get whatever food I want despite being over an hour drive from the mainland, because an impossibly rich maniac<sup><a href="#fn-3-boat" id="fr-3-boat">3</a></sup> built train tracks over the ocean a hundred years ago. Those train tracks became the road and bridges that I skateboarded on. This delights the train kid in me more than I can describe. The best <a href="https://www.ci.marathon.fl.us/community/page/old-seven-mile-bridge">bridge</a> in the world for gliding over the infinite ocean, completely safe from cars, is a couple minutes from my front door, so I can relive the best days of my life any sunny day that I want. And most of them are.</p>

<li id="fn-2-boat">The sequel, Riven, took it even further by setting the game on a chain of five islands, and realistic ones at that (primitive houses instead of rocket ships). No surprise, I love that game even more than Myst. <a href="#fr-2-boat">↩︎︎</a></li>

<title>Farmington Canal Heritage Trail</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/farmington-canal.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?loc=41.4619,-72.9298,10.34z">23.3 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/fcht1.jpg" alt="Bike path along a brook" class="poster">

<p>My main task at work this week, leading up to the long holiday weekend, was creating a client website &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo; Or at least, that&rsquo;s how it initially felt. I&rsquo;m less than two months into this job, and <em>creating</em> whole web sites was implied to be one of those responsibilities I would grow into over the long term. So it was daunting to have a week or so to get this done, along with all my other day to day tasks that are more like <em>fixing</em> websites.</p>

<p>But everything is built on the shoulders of giants, or whatever that expression is. The designer at the company created mockups for every page and designated the fonts and colors. One of the lead developers on my team had just finished a basic website skeleton that covers a bunch of template code and structure. The client only really needed a few marketing pages and templates for blog posts. Once I actually started, building on the work done by everyone before me, it came easily.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/fcht2.jpg" class="right" alt="New Haven - Northampton Railroad sign over trail"><p>The Farmington Canal was dug in the 1820s to create a waterway from New Haven all the way through Connecticut and into Massachusetts. And then, standing on the shoulders of that giant undertaking, the New Haven and Northampton Railroad was built along its right of way in the 1840s and 50s. The railroad was much more effective at moving goods through the state; for one, it didn&rsquo;t freeze in the winter. But it wouldn&rsquo;t have been as easy to do if it wasn&rsquo;t for the canal already there.</p>

<p>Just as the railroad supplanted the canal, cars and, uh, other railroad lines eventually made the New Haven and Northampton Railroad irrelevant. The line was out of use by the 1970s, and by 2000 it had been paved over and turned into the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail. Once again, on the shoulders of the giants that came before it.</p>

<p>Some sections of the trail are still under construction, such as north of Southington to the MA border (according to one sign, opening the <em>next day</em>), or south from Yale&rsquo;s campus to the harbor. Everything in between is glassy-smooth asphalt along the remnants of the canal and/or a collection of rivers and brooks, isolated from car traffic the whole way. It was so pleasant and so easy. Dozens of people were out walking or riding their bikes, many with dogs, two others on longboards. The warehouses and other industrial buildings on either side of the former tracks are now microbreweries and gastropubs. One was a wellness clinic with sandwich boards promoting laser hair removal and semaglutide injections. Not the same as public infrastructure, but probably still standing on the shoulders of some other giant, in its own way.</p>

<title>Pastecard State of the Company, 2024</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/pastecard-sotc-2024.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Costs up like nine hundred percent thanks to the App Store</li>
<li>Revenue up infinity percent thanks to the App Store</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t divide by zero</li>
</ul>

<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>Pastecard formally launched in Q4 2010 in Palo Alto, California. In the years since, it has relocated its headquarters to Jupiter, Florida; Carrboro, North Carolina; and West Palm Beach, Florida. For over twelve years, its only product offering was a free web app. It added a paid iPhone app in Q2 2023 and became one of the fastest-growing companies of all time (revenue-wise).</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brian Sutorius,</strong> alpha dog and beta tester</li>
<li><strong>Hudson the koala puppet, </strong> Chairman of the Board</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product</h2>
<p>Pastecard is a simple notes app. From the first prototype in Q3 2008, through the company&rsquo;s founding in Q3 2010, all the way to Q2 2023, the app was available solely on the web. An internal skunkworks project began in Q2 2017 to create a functionally-identical iPhone app that was never released to the public. It was eventually rewritten from scratch, polished to an acceptable level, and officially listed for sale an impressive six years later.</p>

<h2>Metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li>YAU <em>(yearly active users)</em> in 2023: <strong>16</strong></li>
<li>New users in 2023: <strong>10</strong></li>
<li>Paid users in 2023: <strong>5</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>The company puts absolutely no effort into new user acquisition. By virtue of existing on the web and in the App Store, it is possible that a prospective new user happens upon the product by way of searching for a related keyword. &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; or &ldquo;app,&rdquo; perhaps? It is unfathomable that the company would rank favorably for either. And yet, it appears that the new users continue to trickle in. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the only new users capable of converting to paid users are iPhone owners. This is an unfortunate contribution to the cultural meme that Android users are poors.</p>

<h2>Financials</h2>
<table>
<tr class="toprow"><td>Year</td><td>Costs</td><td>Revenue</td><td>Profit</td></tr>
<tr><td>2022</td><td>$11.88</td><td>$0</td><td>-$11.88</td></tr>
<tr><td>2023</td><td>$108.96</td><td>$1.25</td><td>-$106.81</td></tr>
<tr><td>&Delta;</td><td class="bad">+910%</td><td class="good">+&infin;%</td><td class="bad">-899%</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Operating Expenses</h3>
<p>The company has long celebrated its remarkably low operating expenses due to prudent supplier relationships and offensively underpaid labor. In Q4 2021, it consolidated all of its infrastructure to Google services: i.e. $12/yr for domain registration and 3¢/mo or less for servers. As of this report, that second item has been completely free for a while and the company hopes it will remain this way.</p>
<p>An additional way the company keeps expenses low is by covering all costs with a credit card that offers 1% cash back on all purchases, minimum of 1¢. This amounts to 12¢ back every year on domain registration, and in the months where server costs are 1¢, a complete refund. Such shrewd financial management is usually rewarded with jail time.</p>
<p>However, Apple charges $99/yr for the blessed opportunity to list your software in its App Store. Even with a 3&#10005; cash back multiplier on this particular charge (i.e. $2.97), this is an expense many orders of magnitude larger than what the company has traditionally weathered. Time will tell if this is the telephone-pole-sized straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>

<h3>Revenue</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to overstate the immense pride that the company has in finally bringing in actual USD revenue. Following twelve long years of bleeding money by only offering a free web app, the release of the iPhone app in Q3 2023 opened the door for paying customers. At the low, low price of 29¢, how could they resist. There was an initial flood of purchases in the first week of availability, which diminished to a small drip by the end of the first month, and has been reduced to nothing in almost the full year since.</p>
<p>After Apple took its share and one customer in Brazil was refunded their full purchase price, the company closed 2023 with a whopping $1.25 in revenue.</p>

<h4>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL</h4>
<p>Alan Kay, one of the pioneers of computer science and a direct influence on the Apple ecosystem, once <a href="https://www.folklore.org/Creative_Think.html">said</a>: &ldquo;People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.&rdquo; And Pastecard is now nothing if not really serious about software. Riding high on the success of a real app that makes real money, the company is planning a hardware device to complete the user experience.</p>
<p>It will be the size of a few credit cards stacked together, with a black and white touch screen like a Kindle. At launch, it will load a customer&rsquo;s Pastecard text content over WiFi. The first major update will involve some virtual keyboard trickery so customers can add new text as well. In our increasingly-connected world, it&rsquo;s important to disconnect once in a while and leave your phone at home. With the Pastecard hardware device, customers will be able to enjoy the mental health benefits of disconnecting while still keeping their Pastecard close.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a year since Elon Musk bought Twitter. It got demonstrably worse this January when third-party apps were cut off, and the gradual decline has continued since then. The (many) ads I see are almost all from newly-created accounts for dropshipping companies, whether under their AI-generated storefront names, or AI-generated &ldquo;real people&rdquo; and their testimonials. Many of the actual real people I followed have left, most of the media sources I followed are still there and it&rsquo;s still the most reliable and quick way for me to follow them, so I&rsquo;m still <a href="https://twitter.com/bsuto">on Twitter</a>. I&rsquo;m also on <a href="https://macaw.social/@bsuto">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsuto.com">Bluesky</a>, and <a href="https://posts.cv/bsuto">Posts</a>. I made a Threads account to reserve my handle. Too much, right?</p>
<p>Too much! So I also made <a href="https://bsuto.com">a one-person Twitter app for myself</a>. Yes, another Twitter clone, the worst one possible, to add to a roster of feeds of small text posts to refresh compulsively. The goal is for it to be the place where I post tweet-sized updates that are actually meaningful to me, and I will try to reduce my use of all the other places to only reading or not at all. And this new one is broadcast only, no replies or likes or other engagement &mdash; great for mental health! Followers can either go to my website to read the latest (and only the latest) tweet, or subscribe to an RSS feed of every tweet to automatically get new ones and go through the old ones.</p>
<p>I call it Postecard because it reuses the backend from Pastecard, but, you know, it makes posts.<sup><a href="#fn-1-pc" id="fr-1-pc">1</a></sup> Of course, there were a few hiccups along the way. For example, it literally uses the Pastecard backend, at the Pastecard domain, but I want it to display on my personal domain. So the actual tweet text is an <span class="code">iframe</span> within the little tweet embed, to avoid cross-domain restrictions. Otherwise, the base functionality is the same: a little PHP script that takes my tweet input and writes it to a text file, and a little Javascript that reads the text from that text file when the page loads. There&rsquo;s a little extra Javascript in that iframe to parse out and hyperlink URLs, making sure to load them in the parent frame. And, naturally, a little extra PHP to add the new tweet to the RSS feed file. I have a simple Shortcut saved as an &ldquo;app&rdquo; to both my phone and laptop that prompts for the new tweet text and sends it to the PHP script.</p>
<p>One thing to come out of the downfall of Twitter has been a resurgence in the mindset of owning or controlling your content online. A blog at your own domain name, a social media presence that you can decouple from the provider and take your follows, followers, and archives with you. This simple little project is a combination of both those things. I may not stick with it for as long as I have with these other things, but I do admit it feels pretty cool here at the start.</p>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li id="fn-1-pc">I had this idea for a while for an iPhone app that, in a very straightforward way, allowed people to take a photo from their camera roll, add a message and an address, and print and mail it as a postcard for like $2 each. There have obviously been many apps like this for a long time but I thought I could do it without extraneous branding or upsells. And before I made a real Pastecard app for the App Store, I figured I could reuse that name and stash the backend for the old app somewhere on the new app&rsquo;s marketing site. The dream essentially died when I found out that <em>the</em> Bill Atkinson has already made this app, and it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photocard-by-bill-atkinson/id333208430?platform=iphone">PhotoCard</a>. <a href="#fr-1-pc">↩︎︎</a></li>

<title>Mission Bay Bike Trails</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/mission-bay.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2 class="info"><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=32.775683&lon=-117.234296&zoom=13.64">16 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mbsd1.jpg" alt="Bike path near South Shores Park" class="poster">
<p>Mission Bay might be my favorite place to visit in California. I&rsquo;ve spent spring breaks and senior weeks there, and now a bachelor party too. &ldquo;It's like Cape Cod with palm trees&rdquo; was thrown out there this weekend. And we enjoyed every bit being on the beach, walking to bars and nightlife, and lining up for <a href="https://www.sarasmexicanrestaurant.com">breakfast burritos</a> across the street.</p>
<p>Most of the guys booked their flights back to the east coast on Sunday morning, which was smart. My cross-country flight didn't depart until 9pm. So after saying goodbyes and ignoring the hangover, I got on my skateboard. Because of course this coastal neighborhood that swoops and curves around the water has a network of bike paths and bike-friendly streets.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mbsd2.jpg" alt="PB Pathway sign marking on the street" class="right">I started in Pacific Beach, where one of its designated <a href="https://beautifulpb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pbpathwaysmap-20150722-r1.pdf">PB Pathways</a> (5MB PDF) merged with the Mission Beach boardwalk. Sunday brunch was not the best time to be weaving through the crowds, but at least I wasn&rsquo;t the only one doing it. Way more people were on roller skates! The stretches past densely-packed rental houses were quieter, the ones past the bars and roller coaster were obviously busier. Then a gentle U-turn at the southern tip of the peninsula led me back north along Mission Bay. And this was <em>so</em> quiet. Hardly any wave activity on the bay. More young families or older couples than big groups of delayed spring breakers. I got the same urge my mother did, the last time we came here as a family, to buy a property.</p>
<p>The farther I got from the ocean, the prettier the views became. The bike trail near Sea World cut through fields of wildflowers, and the parallel trail on the other side of the major road leading into the park ran adjacent to the San Diego River. I took a bridge over the river and followed it back to the Pacific, which happened to be at a dog beach. Between the low tide exposing seaweed and other saltwater flora, and the years of built up dog pee, I was inspired to order a Lyft and head to the airport early.</p>

<title>Pastecard in the App Store</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/pastecard-app-store.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Pastecard is a tiny notes app that I made for myself, because I wanted a notes app that fits the way I take notes: for little things I only need to remember for a little while, like a grocery list, or tasks to finish today, or a link to check out later. Something so bare bones it loads fast and it loads on any device, and since I&rsquo;m offloading this stuff onto it so I don&rsquo;t have to remember it myself, I also don&rsquo;t want to have to remember some password for the app either. In 2008, I made a rough version of it that lived at a secret URL on my blog. In 2010, I polished that up and gave it its own domain name. In 2018, I made a rough version of an iOS app that only lived on my phone. And here in 2023, I&rsquo;ve polished that app well enough to put on the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple made two moves that inspired me to attempt this for real: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-groundbreaking-new-technologies-for-app-development/">the introduction of SwiftUI</a> in summer 2019 and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-announces-biggest-upgrade-to-app-store-pricing-adding-700-new-price-points/">announcement of new price levels</a> at the end of 2022.</p>
<h2>SwiftUI</h2>
<p>Whether I can call myself a software developer depends on if you believe writing markup is programming. I like to think I&rsquo;m pretty good at vanilla HTML and CSS, writing declarative statements like &ldquo;make a rectangle that&rsquo;s this wide, this tall, and this color.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all web design is, if you want to be annoying about it: a series of rectangles of varying sizes, laid out in sequences dependent on the size of the screen, containing your content. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of jobs where a designer makes something in Photoshop and hands it to me and says &ldquo;turn this into code.&rdquo; I love those jobs! I&rsquo;m no good at designing things out of thin air, and I don&rsquo;t enjoy the &ldquo;make the logo bigger&rdquo; reviews involved with that either.</p>
<p>Before SwiftUI, designing an iPhone app was more of the Photoshop way of doing things. Traditionally, you would lay out the components of your app visually, and behind the scenes Apple&rsquo;s software would turn it into code for you. Except that code was a goulash of mixed-case alphanumerics, like if you ever opened a Microsoft Word document in Notepad. And that&rsquo;s even before you do stuff like designing a button and then linking what happens when someone taps that button to a function in your &ldquo;actual&rdquo; code. For the first version of the iPhone app that I made for myself, I just blindly followed YouTube tutorials without understanding what I was doing. It worked, and it looked like I wanted it to, but if I came back a couple months later to tweak something I pretty much had to start over.</p>
<p>SwiftUI, instead, functions like the way I&rsquo;ve worked on websites for my entire career. You make declarative statements right there in your code for how you want your rectangles and buttons to look and where you want them to go. I took a <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">SwiftUI class</a> online to really understand it, and came out of that as confident as I was with HTML & CSS, languages I&rsquo;d been writing in for 20 years. That&rsquo;s a testament to the wonderful effectiveness of the instructor, absolutely, but also the similarities between them.</p>
<p>As I write this, SwiftUI has only existed for less than 4 years. And Apple has more or less stated that all future apps for iPhones and MacBooks and iPads should be written in it. So I feel pretty good about setting down roots here. However! The flip side of getting in near the relative beginning is that there are plenty of kinks and outright missing features.</p>
<p>On the plus side, if you stick close to Apple&rsquo;s recommended conventions, you get a lot of functionality for free. If you use the color palette built into the system to declare what color everything should be, then you get the dark mode of those colors automatically. Or if you use the system names for font sizes instead of numbers, they will automatically scale up or down for your older relative whose blue bubbles take up half their screen.</p>
<p>Then again, there are niche pieces of iPhone apps that don&rsquo;t really support SwiftUI yet. One is the launch screen, which briefly appears after you tap the app icon unless you&rsquo;ve used the app recently. Those are still only possible in the old storyboard way of doing things. The closest I could get was forcing a single (solid color) image <a href="https://sarunw.com/posts/launch-screen-using-plist/#navigation-bar">across the navigation bar</a>, which is gross and I look forward to being able to do better soon. The other is the temporary interface when you share something to the app, which by default still comes with a blank storyboard file that you have to <a href="https://airlist.app/blog/swiftui-share-extension">override</a> with SwiftUI code. And there was a third idea involving <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/menus_and_shortcuts/add_home_screen_quick_actions">Home Screen actions</a> that I couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable override for, but I won&rsquo;t say more in case it becomes possible later.</p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m charging the least amount of money possible for an app, which is now 29¢. Apple recently expanded their pricing options to every ten-cent increment, instead of only .49 or .99, and honestly if it were possible to charge nine cents, I would have. Really, I just want this to be <em>not free</em>. This is still an app I mostly made for myself, and now it&rsquo;s in the store not really for the general public, but for hiring managers at potential future jobs to see. If it was free, any fool could download it, hate it, and blast me in the reviews. Or, heaven forbid, they like it and use it a lot, and now my server bill goes up. Or, worst case scenario, it attracts some malcontent who hacks into every part of my life and leaves me destitute and framed for crimes. The great thing about the imperfect human psychology is you can use it to your advantage. And for whatever reason, people hate paying for apps up front.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly stupid, but I think also a little funny, to charge so little for something with a straight face. On top of that, Apple takes a 30% cut of every sale, which is 9¢ rounded up (and you know they&rsquo;ll round up). At a take home of 20¢ per sale, we can do some fun cost-revenue analysis. For example, I would only need to sell two copies every year to break even on my server costs. They&rsquo;re very low, and I&rsquo;m proud of that. (Of course, they&rsquo;d likely go up with more people buying the app and using it, but that&rsquo;s math for a later day.) I would need to sell 60 copies every year to cover the cost of my domain name registration. And &ndash; <em>this one is great</em> &ndash; I would need to sell 481 copies of the app every year to cover the cost of what Apple charges me for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/">the ability to sell it in the first place</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I tend to be self-deprecating about my programming abilities as a defense against rejection. If I say I&rsquo;m not that good first, it won&rsquo;t hurt as much when someone else tells me I&rsquo;m not that good. So with that in mind, I want to honestly say that I know Pastecard is a very simple piece of software. It doesn&rsquo;t attempt to do serious privacy stuff like authentication with passwords or encryption of text. (In addition to rewriting the app in SwiftUI, I rewrote the functional code to use the async/await pattern, but it&rsquo;s not like I know what I&rsquo;m doing there.) It doesn&rsquo;t look fancy in any way. It&rsquo;s the kind of project a good programmer could bang out in a day. It&rsquo;s also not an original iPhone app idea at all. There are plenty of similar apps like <a href="https://notes.scrawlapp.com">Scrawl Notes</a>, <a href="https://quickdraft.app">Quick Draft</a>, <a href="https://dreger.me/edit/">Edit</a>, or bigger players like <a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> or <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>.</p>
<p>But I think mine is done with just as much, if not more, care. And mine has an equally feature-complete website complement whereas some of those don&rsquo;t. That means (even though, again, there aren&rsquo;t passwords) I had to make functions for creating an account and passing that account through the system, whether you&rsquo;re using this app or loading the website on your smart refrigerator.</p>
<p>The rush from working on a coding problem for a while and then finally getting it to work is the main reason I&rsquo;m still on this career path. I&rsquo;ve worked for big companies and tiny companies with iPhone apps in the App Store, and I&rsquo;ve followed plenty of developers online who make their own. So I was familiar with the process of not only making an app, but also the roller coaster that is getting Apple to review it, approve it, and list it for sale. And now that I&rsquo;ve gone through it myself, it&rsquo;s almost just as big a rush and I see why everyone wants to write a blog post about their experience.</p>
<p>So even though this is still mostly just an app for me, I think I&rsquo;m going to keep making it better both for myself and for everyone. I&rsquo;d want to try making a Mac app next, because that&rsquo;s what I have and use. And then maybe more outside-the-app hooks, like support for Siri or Shortcuts, if they make sense. Ultimately I want this to stand as a showcase that reflects what I&rsquo;m capable of in a positive light, so as I get better (and SwiftUI gets better), so will it.</p>
<p>You can buy Pastecard in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pastecard/id1341464454">App Store</a> for 29¢, but please don&rsquo;t.</p>

<title>Marvin Braude Bike Trail</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2 class="info"><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=33.940688&lon=-118.45868&zoom=11.27">22 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mb1.jpg" alt="Marvin Braude Bike Trail" class="poster">
<p>This is it. This is <em>the</em> skateboard trail. Over twenty miles of blissful sidewalk surfing down the beaches where it was invented. Passing through iconic boardwalks that you see on postcards, in movies, all throughout pop culture. My good friend Alex and I rode our longboards from Muscle Beach up to the northern terminus in Pacific Palisades in April 2005, and that&rsquo;s when I got hooked on this whole board trip idea. A few weeks shy of 18 years later, I returned to do the whole thing.</p>
<p>The coastal mountains of Malibu and the rolling hills of Palos Verdes create natural boundaries for this trail. So you start at Will Rogers Beach in Pacific Palisades, with Nobu and all the celebrity hangouts you&rsquo;ve heard of on Bravo behind you, and the Santa Monica pier beckoning in the distance. It&rsquo;s standard beach boardwalk path, concrete weaving between parking lots or public bathrooms and flat expanses of sand. Not that standard means boring, more that you should expect a lot of this.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mb2.jpg" alt="Beachfront house in Santa Monica" class="right">Then you reach the rows of beachfront homes before getting to the heart of Santa Monica. Ever since my first trip to this beach (when my brother Kevin recognized Kevin Bacon and went up to talk to him &ndash; two degrees), I&rsquo;ve been drawn to the house with the external spiral staircase painted bright yellow. It blew my mind when it appeared in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEKdENf5kGk&t=223s">the opening credits of GTA V</a>. A proper kickoff to the day, a mile or two in. Who lives here? How do they deal with the masses of humanity outside their living room window every day? How do they pull out of their garage directly onto the PCH every time they need groceries?</p>
<p>These questions linger as you proceed underneath the Santa Monica pier, away from the distracting lights and sounds of the roller coaster, ferris wheel, and hordes of people. And then the picturesque popular stretch from the pier through Venice, weaving between tagged public facilities, a skatepark where I would never venture myself, a boardwalk of exactly the kind of tourist trap shops you&rsquo;re imagining, and the outdoor fitness area of world-famous Muscle Beach. I was riding in the early afternoon after a morning of 40&deg; rain, so even though the sun was out, there weren&rsquo;t that many guns out.</p>
<p>When you hit the Venice Beach pier, the trail temporarily ends and you have to ride in the bike lane of Washington Blvd until the trail picks up again to go around Marina del Rey. This part is somewhat shaded by deciduous trees and devoid of sand, a nice palate cleanser before going through the Ballona Wetlands and out on the jetty to get back to the beach.</p>
<p>And after a brief return of paved trail separating small but fancy homes from the sand, you reach the airport. This was one of the first things I remember exploring <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pQcGDM2PkaD5mYLD9">in Google Earth</a>, the wasteland of a planned community between LAX and the ocean. The streets are laid out in a neat little neighborhood grid, without any homes. You can only imagine how impossible it would have been to live under the constant air traffic, as loud as it is on the beach. I clambered up the coastal cliff to see if the area was open for exploration and of course it isn&rsquo;t. We still have to take off our shoes and throw away our water bottles before getting on a plane, they&rsquo;re not going to let some helmet-wearing fool like me muck around in the open space next to the runways.</p>
<p>You almost think the city planners figured that if a whole neighborhood was lost to the airport, they may as well keep putting the boring stuff on the surrounding land. So there&rsquo;s a mile or so of water facilities and power plants to pass afterward, before returning to the final segment of proper boardwalk paths through three charming beach towns: Manhattan, Hermosa, and Redondo. There are a couple notable stretches, like briefly detouring inland to stay on the sidewalks through Redondo Beach, and then cutting back toward the coast and going through the parking garage (still on a sectioned-off and signed path!) of the marina.</p>
<p>Then it ends unceremoniously at a lifeguard station in Torrance County Beach. There&rsquo;s no sign, nothing except the mile marker of 0.0 painted on the pavement. I picked up my board and walked up the steep exit ramp to figure out a way back to the city via car, in true Los Angeles fashion.</p>

<title>Rincon Bike Trail</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2 class="info"><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=34.364291&lon=-119.453521&zoom=14.41">3.5 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rbt1.jpg" alt="Rincon Bike Trail" class="poster">
<p>I have been fascinated by Rincon Island since I first saw it. It was probably the summer of 2002, and I was visiting west coast colleges with my dad. We drove down from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, passing Rincon Island at night. Warm lights along its relatively gigantic causeway were lit, as were harsher, brighter spotlights focused down on the island itself. &ldquo;Party island,&rdquo; my dad remarked, and I believed it.</p>
<p>A couple years later, now attending college in Southern California, I had the opportunity to drive by it again in the daylight. It was clear now that this was not some millionaire&rsquo;s play island but something more mundane. I didn&rsquo;t have time to pull over and investigate, so I instead furiously Googled it once back on campus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rincon_Island_(California)">The Wikipedia article</a> was much shorter back then, and most other resources were legal documents or court rulings. I lazily read through what I could understand and tried to summarize all of it in a blog entry at a different website (since taken offline).</p>
<p>After graduation, on another Bay Area to Los Angeles drive, I finally pulled over to the tiny community of Mussel Shoals and walked up to the causeway. Of course, it was closed off to normal folk with a locked gate. I took what photos I could with my phone and Googled it again when I reached my destination. More of the same oil drilling and gas refinement. But neatly packaged on an artificial island with palm trees and a bridge back to the mainland, instead of the offshore platforms dotting the horizon.</p>
<p>Clearly I have an affinity for riding a skateboard along bike trails, but until 2014, the bike trail past Rincon Island was simply the shoulder of the 101. I think anyone who did that on a bicycle was out of their mind, let alone on a skateboard. So it&rsquo;s nice to have this short stretch of smooth pavement right next to the 101 but safely separated by concrete and steel barriers. You get the rush of freeway traffic to your left, the infinite expanse of the Pacific to your right, and the mysterious allure of Rincon Island halfway down.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2 class="info"><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=40.146331&lon=-105.099694&zoom=13.79">6.3 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/svlh1.jpg" alt="St Vrain Greenway" class="poster">
<p>My dad has long been vocal about not enjoying the retirement life in Florida. He&rsquo;s a native Californian who needs a variety of landscapes, topography, and weather changes to describe in detail every time we talk on the phone. Florida ranged from flat and hot to flat and very hot. But my mom didn&rsquo;t want to return to California, so when a steal of a house in Colorado showed up in their late night Zillow browsing, allowing them to almost literally meet in the middle, they jumped on it. Cold winters and all.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/svlh2.jpg" alt="Left Hand Creek Greenway" class="right">Prior to their new house, I&rsquo;d only been to the state a couple times, always staying in Denver. Sometimes, exclusively the Denver airport. So it&rsquo;s been one pleasant surprise after another, discovering the expansive plains with beautiful mountain backdrops. And since bike culture (part of a general outdoorsy-ness) is so big out here, all this flat land is crisscrossed with excellent bike trails.</p>
<p>One of my parents&rsquo; new favorite spots to take a walk is the Sandstone Ranch. We drove out together and looked at the historic buildings, dramatic cliff formations, and a mama deer leading her baby across the St Vrain creek. Then they turned back to their car and let me find my way home. One perfectly maintained trail went along that creek until it met the Left Hand creek, and then another perfectly maintained trail followed that. I crossed a big road, doglegged behind a craft brewery, and all of a sudden I was on the main road leading back into my parents&rsquo; neighborhood.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a Florida man for good (in more ways than one?) but it&rsquo;s hard to resist the abundance of flat, paved trails with breathtaking views out here. Many all but leading to your front door.</p>

<h2 class="info"><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=30.388248&lon=-89.972626&zoom=11.74">27.8 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/tt1.jpg" alt="Tammany Trace" class="poster">
<p>The moments at the boundary between two larger stretches of time feel inconsequential. Why can I drink or vote tomorrow but not today? What&rsquo;s the point of reminiscing on the last day of a year that felt every bit the same as the previous one? That&rsquo;s what I told myself going into today: it only happens to be the last day of the year, no need to put any thought or emotional weight into it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tammanytrace.org">Tammany Trace</a> is another former rail line converted to paved trail, from Covington, Louisiana to Slidell. The Lyft driver said Covington looked like a bad neighborhood when we drove by decaying row houses, and offered to stay near the little town square if I changed my mind. But time unrelentingly moves forward, and so must I. Wait, I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be thinking about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the trail begins at what used to be the Covington train station, with the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s largest&rdquo; statue of Ronald Reagan. A couple kicks and it was behind me. The air smelled like a campfire.</p>
<video class="right" muted controls poster="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/tt2p.jpg"><source src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/tt2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Soon I rolled into the historic town of Abita Springs. Everything here was like a designed set, from the former train station converted into town museum, eponymous <a href="https://www.abitabrewpub.com">brew pub</a>, and tourist magnet <a href="http://abitamysteryhouse.com">mystery house</a>. A group of three were sitting in chairs outside the entrance, and the man on the left turned to me as I approached. &ldquo;You’ve been here before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good answer.&rdquo; They all got up and followed me in to take my admission fee, and let me wander around. This place is less like the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot and more like a tiny Wall Drug, if that means anything to you. Goofy alligator taxidermy and New Orleans bric-a-brac were plastered onto every surface and crammed into every corner. Easily worth the $5, and located directly on the trail.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I&rsquo;m glad Abita Springs was near the beginning. The trail was two long straightaways afterward, one going south for nine miles and one going east for fifteen. I would have been too tired to appreciate it if I&rsquo;d come from other way. I&rsquo;m also glad I didn&rsquo;t stop for a beer or lunch and then keep going, more for the risk of getting sleepy than anything else. A couple times over the rest of the afternoon, I would register that the scenery looked like Saint Denis from Red Dead Redemption 2 &mdash; a video game location based on New Orleans. When I first played the game, I would think about how <em>its</em> scenery looked like New Orleans. It&rsquo;s a wonder I went to a college.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the downside of rails to trails. It&rsquo;s not like the original railroads were planned to go through the most scenic and interesting areas of the country. Not that this wasn&rsquo;t beautiful, it absolutely was, but apart from the sections that ran through small downtowns, there wasn&rsquo;t much to distract me from doing an internal year in review.</p>
<p>The trail was closed and blocked off in three separate places. The first was a still-under-construction tunnel going under a medium-busy road. It looked finished enough, but there was brackish standing water the whole way through. So I walked around the barricade and jaywalked across the street. This must have been how people went before, right? No problem.</p>
<p>The second blockage was a little more serious: another barricade with loose chain link fence branching off either side into the woods. A benevolent rule-breaker had already peeled back a small section of the fence, making it no issue to scramble under. This closed-off section went under Interstate 12, which was itself under construction, and I guess sending dirt and debris and chaos below to the trail. But I traversed it just fine, and there was another hole in the chain link fence on the other side. No problem.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/tt3.jpg" alt="Raised drawbridge over Bayou Lacombe" class="left">
<p>Third time&rsquo;s the charm. Approaching Bayou Lacombe, a black snake crossed the trail in front of me. Superstitious omen? Voodoo? I rolled up to a third barricade, once again with the extra fencing pushed aside. The victory was temporary, as it led to a drawbridge stuck in the raised position. There was no other way in sight over the river. A sign on the drawbridge house noted that trail facilities were closed on holidays, including New Year&rsquo;s Eve. There&rsquo;s no escaping it!</p>
<p>So I had to double back and venture down a two lane road with no shoulder and no sidewalk through Lacombe. Harrowing. A dog leapt from its front porch and tore down the driveway into the road to bark after me. I shouted &ldquo;No!&rdquo; over my shoulder, at the same time its owner called it back, and the dog listened to at least one of us. The road went by a gigantic tent full of fireworks for sale. I bought a Gatorade there from a guy in a t-shirt that said &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Best Father&rdquo; with the &ldquo;th&rdquo; scratched out and replaced with &ldquo;rt&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For no reason other than a stubborn completionism compulsion, once I crossed the river on the road and made my way back to the trail, I made sure to go to the other side of the raised drawbridge. I threw away the empty Gatorade bottle in the trash can there. Guess no one will come by to empty it for a while because tomorrow&rsquo;s a holiday too. At least the rest of the way was impeccable trail, smooth and almost devoid of other people. I was even able to record and <a href="https://twitter.com/bsuto/status/1477015566779138049">tweet</a> a video without slowing down or stopping.</p>
<p>I still love doing this: starting in one place, ending in another, and absorbing the inbetween at a human pace. I guess that&rsquo;s how time works too. Maybe some stretches are monotonous, repetitive, or seem to offer little. Others can be wildly exciting and even ones you&rsquo;d eagerly return to. And every once in a while something unexpected comes up and throws off your plans. Happy New Year.</p>

<title>Jim</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/jim.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Jim and I met at our town&rsquo;s school for grades 5-6, probably at chess club, which was less about playing chess than speedrunning Oregon Trail during lunch. One kid&rsquo;s idea of a finishing strategy was trying to drop his apple on the king so that it pierced through. That might have been Jim. I remember noticing right away that he was <em>funny.</em> He was always on, in a way that can be annoying when you&rsquo;re an adult, but is intoxicating when you&rsquo;re a kid.</p>
<p>When the teacher would kick us out of her classroom for egregiously not playing chess, and we&rsquo;d have to eat lunch in the basement cafeteria, Jim might hold court at the end of a table. &ldquo;Time for Cooking With Jim,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d announce in a hilarious voice, and then mush two or three components of his meal together. We&rsquo;d continue to eat lunch together all throughout high school, often at my house. One time he emptied a cup of peanuts onto the trampoline in the backyard, shouted &ldquo;Cooking With Jim presents: peanut butter!&rdquo; and hopped around in a circle.</p>
<p>He taught himself how to play guitar, and so I asked my parents to buy me one, and followed his same trajectory at a six month lag. His house had video game consoles and mine didn&rsquo;t, so we spent hours at his place laughing at the poop monster in Conker&rsquo;s Bad Fur Day or marveling at the first Halo. He would even host LAN party sleepovers in that age before WiFi, and we all would spend too much time trying to network the big computers we&rsquo;d lugged from home before giving up and crowding around his.</p>
<p>Of course, I had other friend groups growing up, and Jim did too. He spent summers at a camp in Canada, becoming a counselor in high school. One autumn he threw an archetypal parents-away-for-the-weekend house party and it was a lot of his camp friends. They had all smuggled vodka from Canada in their Nalgenes. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know most of the people there, Jim made sure I had a good time. It was the first time I got drunk.</p>
<p>Our high school had foreign exchange programs, but either I rarely crossed paths with the exchange students or we only got a handful a year. I will never forget, however, the day that an exchange student from France walked into our senior year English class. She had what could generously be called a resting glum face. Jim tapped me on the arm and said, in a deep hushed voice that was wildly different from his usual bright boisterousness, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the saddest person I have ever seen.&rdquo; And I didn&rsquo;t retain a single thing from that class because I spent the full fifty minutes trying not to burst out laughing.</p>
<p>I got involved in the theater department by trying out for a Shakespeare play in ninth grade. It was very cliquey and so I got sucked in and stayed, despite the main class track being more about interpretive dance movement than stage acting. The bright shining spot was the spring show, featuring shorter plays written and directed by the students. Jim played a maid in one of those, with the full outfit and everything, and it was the only time we overlapped. His performance was a surgical strike of humor in what was otherwise four years of controlled breathing for me.</p>
<p>It was your typical theater kids clique, even without the added weirdness of leotard-clad capoeira. The kind who wrote French maid characters into their scripts before they were 18. Jim did impressions of a few of them, none funnier than the girl who was maybe cream of the crop kooky. Like all the best impressions, Jim&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t ape her voice or physicality, but invented a goofy behavior that exemplified her unique choices. Rather than own a Discman like the rest of us, Jim&rsquo;s impression had her placing a CD down an index finger and spinning the disc with her other hand, the way a Harlem Globetrotter balances a basketball, then singing the hits of the day out loud, in Jim&rsquo;s operatic falsetto: &ldquo;Can you take me-ee higher? Doodley-doodley-doo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim stayed in Ohio for college, and I went out to California. We chatted consistently over AIM, sharing photos, music, and stories. I still have a <a href="https://bsuto.com/articles/jim-counselor.jpg">photo</a> he sent me from his final summer as a camp counselor: he&rsquo;s sitting on a beach holding a bowl of soup, wearing a Ninja Turtles t-shirt that&rsquo;s in Spanish. The bowl of soup is resting on a kid&rsquo;s head, one of his campers who has been buried in the sand. Both Jim&rsquo;s and the kid&rsquo;s expressions are priceless.</p>
<p>He sent me an essay he wrote that first year of college. I think he&rsquo;d gotten it graded already, and shared it with me in the spirit of &ldquo;look what I got away with.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t remember what it was about in general or what class it was for. All I remember is it included the phrase &ldquo;cell phones, which are sandwich-sized devices, &hellip;&rdquo; and that phrase still comes to mind every once in a while.</p>
<p>The summer after our first year of college was, in hindsight, the perfect way to exit our teenage years. Jim started a garage rock band and invited me to join. He was obviously on guitar, and his friend Bill was a guitar prodigy, so I was relegated to bass. (Luckily my brother Kevin had one that he wasn&rsquo;t using.) Another of Jim&rsquo;s friends Ben played drums. We never got to lyrics, but we laid down a couple melodies and rhythm sections, alternating between Jim&rsquo;s garage and the big house at his family&rsquo;s farm all summer. Those MP3s, to this day, have more plays than 90% of my iTunes library. Not because we were that supremely good, but because they bring back the memories of jamming with those guys.</p>
<p>Once we all went back to college, that was the end of the band. But Jim continued to record stuff in his dorm, messing around with drum loops and effects in GarageBand. He started singing too. Every track he sent me is also high up there in iTunes plays. The best one, the one that sums up who Jim consistently was from the time I met him, begins with him saying flatly &ldquo;uh, this song&rsquo;s called <a href="https://bsuto.com/articles/cheap.mp3">cheap</a>.&rdquo; He strums a four chord progression on his acoustic guitar while chirping the word &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; at a faster rate and higher pitch. When it&rsquo;s over, you can hear him laughing at himself for a split second before he cuts the recording off. Everyone who has heard this song loves it.</p>
<p>Jim came out to California to visit me once at college, and I went out to New York to visit him after we had graduated. His paternal grandfather, also James Rorimer, was one of the Monuments Men (the one played by Matt Damon). As such, there was a huge apartment that belonged to his family near the Met. It was full of art pieces that I liked to imagine were on rotation out of galleries, like the giant suit of armor in the entryway. Not a bad place to stay while Jim got his Master&rsquo;s at Columbia, and not at all a bad place to visit. We went to the Met of course, and the Cloisters, but also to the secret burger joint in Le Parker Meridien. I was bad at swiping my MetroCard and Jim convinced me to hop the turnstile, whereupon I was immediately caught and ticketed.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t hang out much in person after that, but we kept in touch. Jim had a penchant for business ideas and I was often called on to help execute them. In chronological order, I made him websites for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Computer:</strong> instead of water cooling your PC, why not submerge the entire computer in oil, which has the same cooling properties as water without the risk of short circuiting it? Open Computer develops and open sources plans and parts lists to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Wolf Shirt Girl:</strong> a lifestyle brand centered around the three-wolves-howling-at-the-moon tshirt that got popular in the late 2000s. To his credit, Jim was ahead of the curve on this one.</li>
<li><strong>NYBee:</strong> an organization dedicated to saving the honeybee in part by ensuring it&rsquo;s legal to keep hives in New York City. This was by far his most successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Park Avenue Christian Church Landmark:</strong> a petition to prevent a historic church from being demolished.</li>
<li><strong>Petistal:</strong> a social network to remember deceased pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last time I saw Jim in person was his wedding in July 2017, at his family farm in Ohio. The ceremony was beautiful, and the reception went long. Those of us left at the end of the night jumped (with varying amounts of our clothes on) into the pool, which was usually off limits when I had gone to the farm as a kid. Jim and WeiWei had a baby a couple years later. &ldquo;Charlotte is the best and so funny,&rdquo; he told me in an email. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s into bopping everything. She&rsquo;s much smarter than her parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that same email, in July 2020, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage three gastric cancer that April. They were living in China, and Charlotte&rsquo;s classmate was the grandson of &ldquo;the best surgeon in China&rdquo; so Jim was able to go through chemo and a serious procedure that removed his esophagus, but left him optimistic. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a proper FaceTime in the next few weeks. I can&rsquo;t speak but I can kind of whisper. Lol the irony&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did have that FaceTime, and a couple more, and then we fell back to texting. They moved back to Ohio and bought a house. He continued various treatments, at one point writing &ldquo;I resemble a cooked lobster.&rdquo; The last thing we texted about was an upcoming remake of a video game we both played as kids.</p>
<p>Since learning that Jim passed, I&rsquo;ve been listening to his music from college a lot. More his solo stuff than the stuff we played together, because his solo stuff has his voice. I think a lot of people are doing the same. WeiWei shared a video of Charlotte, as promised, bopping around to &ldquo;Cheap&rdquo;. I miss him terribly already, and it&rsquo;s awful he left so soon, but oh man did he put a whole lot of good stuff into the world while he was here.</p>

<title>The GQ Interview: 36-year-old Brian Sutorius, as 26-year-old Brian Sutorius dreamed he would be</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/gq-interview-2021.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p><strong>GQ: So you sold your modest Beverly Hills home and now you live on a boat!</strong></p>
<p>BS: Yeah, I had to get out of California. I didn&rsquo;t like it there, it was too expensive and the whole state stinks. And in the process of moving out, and being on the road, I thought &ldquo;what if I took an RV and made it so it could float,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s where me and my family live now.</p>
<p><strong>Like a house boat?</strong></p>
<p>How dare you. I saw a house boat once, and it was disgusting. This is so different. We figured out a way to incinerate all our waste, so we&rsquo;re not dumping it into the ocean or a waste facility back on land. It just kind of disappears in a flash of light, no smell or anything. Super clean and sterile. It&rsquo;s like what would happen on a spaceship. Ooh, a spaceship.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>Guess where that houseboat I saw was docked. That&rsquo;s right, California.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned your family, so let&rsquo;s talk about that. You&rsquo;ve been married now for eight years.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! And it&rsquo;s been a dream. No fights, no egos, all smooth sailing. No pun intended. Look, I can be honest about myself, I didn&rsquo;t have a history of solid relationships before. I mean, I was in some long term relationships, and they were solid, but I wasn&rsquo;t confident in myself. And so I was often performing for my partner rather than being my true self or expressing what I wanted, which led to breakups that I am not proud of.</p>
<p><strong>It certainly sounds like you&rsquo;ve made progress though.</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the great thing about therapy. You go in, they ask you a couple questions, you tell them your life story, they tell you how to think from then on, and you do. It&rsquo;s so simple and straightforward, and it worked immediately for me.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us how you two met?</strong></p>
<p>After Parks and Recreation was cancelled following its disastrous first season, Rashida [Jones] and I both auditioned for the next Mike Schur project.</p>
<p><strong>The Good Place?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>Which one, then?</strong></p>
<p>Hoops, the third one in his mockumentary trilogy. First it was The Office with a paper company, then Parks and Recreation with a city government, and finally Hoops, the one about a semi-professional basketball team. I was up for the point guard, Rashida was for one of the assistant coaches. Pretty progressive for the time! Well, maybe. Nobody picked up the pilot.</p>
<p>Anyway, we really hit it off. We bonded over watching compilations of each others&rsquo; blooper reels and drinking palomas.</p>
<p><strong>How did you propose?</strong></p>
<p>Look, I have never been into these grand displays of affection and putting someone into the spotlight. So I didn&rsquo;t want it to be a big thing, like a scavenger hunt leading up to me popping the question or something. Going back to therapy for a bit, I know <em>now</em> that this was me putting my wants and needs onto someone else, and not thinking about what she would actually want. You learn a lot in therapy.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I downloaded some clips from I Love You Man off of YouTube and put my face on Paul Rudd&rsquo;s body in all the scenes where he proposes to her and talks about marriage and stuff. It was actually a lot harder than it looks! There&rsquo;s no easy way to do that in iMovie.</p>
<p><strong>So where is Rashida now?</strong></p>
<p>On set.</p>
<p><strong>And where are your kids?</strong></p>
<p>This really expensive daycare back on shore. I mean, you can agree, this boat is incredibly safe and a fine place to raise a family. But it&rsquo;s a little isolating and we want the kids to grow up socially well-rounded. We all have so much fun when everyone comes home in the afternoon. We play catch on the top deck, try to break speed records on the water slide, I even let them have a little screen time, why not. They&rsquo;re still young of course, but I can already tell that when they start bringing their friends over, their friends are going to think I&rsquo;m cool.</p>
<p>You know what, I just realized. The show was called Hoops because it was about basketball, yes, but also about the metaphorical hoops we all jump through to get what we want.</p>
<p><strong>Getting back to that, you haven&rsquo;t appeared in television or movies since around then. You switched careers entirely.</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right! It&rsquo;s somewhat cliche for an actor to open a restaurant and slap their name on it, but I wanted to do more. I wanted to actually cook the food, and design the whole experience. Lay out the dining area, make decisions about tableware, and live in the heat of the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with the concept?</strong></p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love sliders? I love sliders. Everyone loves sliders. So initially it was just going to be a straightforward tiny-burger joint, very brutalist, exposed duct work like at Chipotle. But I wanted to be better than Wahlburgers. I wanted to focus on sustainability, and be responsible in my choice of ingredients. So I waited for someone to invent these vegan alternatives we use now that are indistinguishable from the traditional beef and cheese. It&rsquo;s humane, it doesn&rsquo;t contribute to the massive resource hog that factory farming is, and we can recycle all the packaging.</p>
<p><strong>Right, you were at the front of the plant-based movement.</strong></p>
<p>Is that what everything is made of? They never told me. I guess it would have to be, what else is there.</p>
<p><strong>Bit Burger is the fastest growing restaurant franchise in history.</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fun fact, I got the name from this German beer I used to drink a lot in my early 20s. But it&rsquo;s a different market, so they were cool with it. If we ever find a quick and easy way to get liquor licenses, I&rsquo;ve committed to having Bitburger on tap at every location.</p>
<p>And speaking of that &ndash; quick and easy licenses &ndash; that&rsquo;s the secret to our success. I&rsquo;m happy to talk about it, let other companies copy it. There&rsquo;s nothing to these restaurants, they have wildly low startup costs so it&rsquo;s really easy to become a franchisee. I took a lot of lessons learned from my boat and applied them to the restaurants. We use the same toilets there, you know, just vaporizing everything that goes into the bowl, so you don&rsquo;t have to hook into city plumbing and sewer systems. You just lay down a concrete slab and drop a prefab shipping container restaurant on there. Everything is cooked on those electric griddles you can get in an end cap at Bed Bath and Beyond. Ingredients are delivered fresh daily and kept in little dorm room cube fridges and coolers, no need for deep freezers. All powered by the solar panels on the roof, of course. Completely self-sustainable and off the grid.</p>
<p><strong>Wait, there&rsquo;s no plumbing at any of these restaurants? What about hand washing?</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what hand sanitizer is for! And we recycle the plastic dispensers when they&rsquo;re empty, of course.</p>
<p><strong>The restaurant business is notoriously stressful and yet you seem relaxed most if not all of the time. How do you wind down after a busy day?</strong></p>
<p>Smoke weed, doy! <em>(covers the audio recorder with his hand)</em> That&rsquo;s the word they still use, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sure.</strong></p>
<p><em>(removes hand from audio recorder and speaks directly into it)</em> And I&rsquo;m very good at it!</p>

<title>Lake to Lakes Trail</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/lake-to-lakes.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=41.500809&lon=-81.56195&zoom=12.8">11.9 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/llt1.jpg" alt="Rockefeller Park bridge" class="poster">
<p>The schools where my brothers and I went for K-4 and 5-6 were on the same gigantic city block, bordered at the northeast corner by <a href="https://doanbrookpartnership.org/maps/">Doan Brook</a>. This little creek was mostly important to us because when we would sled down the hill there during winter, almost ending up in the creek meant you had a good run. If I ever walked the long way home from school, the road would go over the creek and once or twice I scrambled down the bank to investigate the little tunnel it took. This was around the time I had to read <em>Hatchet</em> for class, so I started imagining a similar story about the boy who lived in the creek tunnel under the road. He kept his pencil and notebook in a ziploc bag to keep it from getting wet. He didn&rsquo;t hunt rabbits for food, despite there being many rabbits around that creek. I think he stole cereal from a nearby house.</p>
<p>I got my learner&rsquo;s permit at 15&half;, license at 16, and did occasionally drive one of our family&rsquo;s two minivans while I was still in high school, but for the majority of my time before going to college, I rode a bike everywhere. My budget-conscious parents bought a handful of stolen-and-unclaimed bikes at a police auction once, so there was always one available. Whether with friends or alone, I&rsquo;d tackle the many dirt trails through city parks, down hills, by the creek, progressing from young-boy-survives-the-wilderness-alone daydreams to avoiding cracks in the sidewalk. Not the traditional ones between panes, you can&rsquo;t avoid those on a bike unless you bunny hop every half second. All other cracks were like enemy lasers and my bike was a spaceship. What I&rsquo;m saying is, I grew up on the nature trails in and around Shaker Heights, usually on a bike.</p>
<p>When I was in sixth grade, a kid at school ran away from home in the middle of the night. He was on his bike somewhere in downtown Cleveland early the next morning when he was hit by a truck and died. Among the shock and the sadness, I remember being so impressed that he made it that far on a bike. We only ever took the train into Cleveland to watch a movie at the mall or go to a baseball game, and that felt like it took forever, each way, on a freaking train. Or, when our family would drive to the airport, that also felt like it took forever, and that was in a car, <em>on the highway</em>. Years later, someone else in my class did their senior project on Doan Brook, and how its watershed starts somewhere near Shaker&rsquo;s eastern boundary, and it weaves its way through town and indeed through Cleveland to empty out into Lake Erie. And that was when I finally realized this little creek near my school was a direct link to the big city.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/llt2.jpg" alt="Baldwin Reservoir" class="center">
<p class="caption">Baldwin Reservoir, where all my childhood poop and pee was flushed</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 20 years since I graduated from high school, which is frankly absurd and should not be allowed. Nevertheless, today I started a little farther east from where Doan Brook begins, and skateboarded to where it meets Lake Erie, something that only became possible <a href="https://planning.clevelandohio.gov/bike/lakeLake.html">recently</a>. The first couple miles were on a network of smoothly paved trails in the median of Shaker Boulevard, at least until the train line took over. Then it merged into a sequence of trails that follows the creek downtown. After a scary big downhill and one of the most confusing traffic intersections in all of Cleveland (during which the creek is culverted below the roads), the creek meanders through a collection of <a href="http://www.culturalgardens.org/garden/">cultural gardens</a>.</p>
<p>I reached the lake and took a few photos, then opened Lyft to see how much a ride back home would cost. It was almost $30 and estimated to take an hour and a half, pretty much as long as it took me to go that far on my own. So instead I rode along the shoreline, past the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, to the main train station downtown. I got a ticket and rode the green line back, the same as when I saw Blue Streak at the theater. That movie came out in 1999.</p>

<title>Monon &amp; other trails</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/monon-and-others.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=39.870867&lon=-86.152377&zoom=10.62">36.4 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mt1.jpg" alt="Monon Trail" class="poster">
<p>I went to Vermont a couple years ago, and it struck me as the whitest place I&rsquo;d ever been. Sitting here writing this today, I think the areas around the Monon Trail beat it. Vermont is aspirationally white. They have Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s, and both Ben and Jerry are good people who give to and fight for good causes. They ride bikes and buses and generally keep fit. They recycle. The northern outskirts of Indianapolis, through which the Monon Trail runs, is mostly farmland. Some grain silos displayed words and imagery aligning the owners to a certain side of the political spectrum. Everyone was driving a truck. All the fellas had the kind of facial hair that grows from not having time to maintain it.</p>
<p>This was my first ride since getting vaccinated. And of course I didn&rsquo;t stop to ask everyone I passed their vaccination status, I simply assumed they were. Either way, it was the first time I wasn&rsquo;t wearing a mask and neither was anyone else. It was a proud return to the most white of gestures, passing each other on a recreational trail and giving the kind of tight closed-mouth smile that makes both your lips disappear. I think we do this because deep down we know we&rsquo;re frauds, and it scares us. You hear on nature shows that canines, territorial apes, I don&rsquo;t know, freak fish, all show their teeth as a warning. We sacrifice what little of our lips we have to <em>hide</em> our teeth, because despite any outward show of strength, we&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvrpb4k6vag&t=15s">scared of confrontation</a>. It would be all too fitting that my day would end on the White River Trail.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mt2.jpg" alt="Broad Ripple Rainbow Bridge" class="right">But before then, the first five miles or so were exquisitely smooth asphalt through endless rows of corn and soybeans. The Monon trails continued through the suburbs (sliding back toward Vermont on the white spectrum): outdoor recreational facilities, classy strip malls, and endless rows of identical townhouses. All the while, impeccably maintained and effortless to push. At some point, the Monon transitioned from a purpose-built trail to a converted rails-to-trail, so the path got a little narrower, the pavement got a little rougher, and the scenery got a little less scenic. But still a protected lane, separate from traffic, weaving through quirky neighborhoods like Broad Ripple with its rainbow bridge.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mt3.jpg" alt="Indianapolis Cultural Trail" class="left">Kind of all of a sudden, the Monon Trail hit the big city of Indianapolis and gave way to its Cultural Trail that zig-zags through downtown. This trail is an extra wide sidewalk lane, set in brick instead of concrete, and frequently decorated with glyphs of people biking, walking, rollerblading, never skateboarding. And if its name is to be believed, judging by the businesses with front doors along its path, Indianapolis has a rich cultural history of microbreweries and CBD shops. Of course, being the state capital, there are also beautiful regal government buildings, and more than a fair share of curiosities.</p>
<p>At one point, the Cultural Trail cuts into a city block, away from the sidewalk and the street, to run down a back alley where restaurants would usually take their garbage. An art installation in this particular back alley named <a href="https://indyculturaltrail.org/art/chatham-passage/">Chatham Passage</a> pumps the aroma of roses instead. Of course, it looks like a very fancy sewer grate, so the first time I passed I literally did not take the time to stop and smell the roses. When I returned hours later, I honestly still couldn&rsquo;t really smell anything. Cool idea regardless.</p>
<p>As the Cultural Trail passes over the intersection of two major interstate highways, a discreet sign beckons the pedestrian to venture into a small thicket and take a rest. After a brief winding trail surrounded by vegetation, you reach <a href="http://www.idleindy.com">The Idle</a>, a small park with an elevated view of the constant motion of highway traffic. Take a breather in some reclaimed stadium seats. Why not.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mt4.jpg" alt="The Idle" class="center">
<p>The Cultural Trail will lead you all the way out of downtown, into Indianapolis&rsquo; historic (read: more diverse, both in terms of race and class) outer neighborhoods. There is still a network of riverside trails here that will take you back up toward downtown. First up was the optimistically named Pleasant Run Trail. My time with it was cut short by bridge and road construction, so I took to a regular sidewalk before hopping onto the White River Trail and working my way north again. There are plenty of highlights, perhaps the old Washington Street bridge over the White River, linking a big park containing the city zoo and the part of downtown with museums and the NCAA headquarters, and closed off to all car traffic. For me, it was seeing the outflow of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogue%27s_Run">Pogue&rsquo;s Run</a>, a creek that they built the whole city on top of. From the trail, it looked like it came directly out of Lucas Oil Stadium, some kind of runoff metaphor for the post-Peyton Colts.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/mt5.jpg" alt="Pogue&rsquo;s Run outflow under Lucas Oil Stadium" class="center">
<p>I crack wise, but there was a lot more to Indianapolis than I was ready to give credit for. Within skateboarding distance, there are gigantic city buildings, hipster neighborhoods, suburbs, sprawling farms, and what some might call rougher areas. Not to mention a tree on the capitol grounds, sprouted from a seed that went <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/moon_trees/indianapolis_tree.html">to the moon</a> and back.</p>

<title>See You Later</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYlpUxFbgTM">Outer Wilds</a> is the best video game I&rsquo;ve ever played. Its art style, storytelling, soundtrack, and freedom of exploration are all excellent. If you haven&rsquo;t played it and there&rsquo;s any possibility you might, please <a href="#skip">skip ahead</a> because this will spoil the ending.</p>
<p>Now, as you already know since you&rsquo;ve played it through, the premise of the game is that you&rsquo;re a rookie astronaut in a solar system at the end of its sun&rsquo;s life. 22 minutes after the game begins, the sun explodes and destroys everything, game over. A relic from an ancient civilization brings you back and you get to play those 22 minutes over again. Everything is reset. Other characters in the game have no idea you&rsquo;ve lived and died however many times. But you retain your memories of all your previous playthroughs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUmSVcttXnI">Edge of Tomorrow</a>. Much like Tom Cruise builds on each life cycle, gaining knowledge and experience to defeat an alien invasion, you play through Outer Wilds exploring your solar system and reading ancient runes to, ostensibly, stop the sun from blowing up. It is a game where you learn <em>how</em> to play as you learn <em>why</em> to play.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve pieced all the histories and mysteries together, and bring the thing to the place, the game calmly guides you through a beautiful ending sequence&hellip; and the sun still blows up. You see your friends you met along the way one final time, and everyone makes peace with the inevitability of their time having come. I wasn&rsquo;t ready for this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="skip">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>
<p>We all have a time; for most it&rsquo;s unknown, which can either be scary or comforting. A clearer idea of that time, from the diagnosis of a terminal disease for example, certainly reschedules the rest of one&rsquo;s life. I&rsquo;m far from the first person to <a href="https://egmnow.com/outer-wilds-helped-me-confront-the-inevitability-of-death/">write about</a> how Outer Wilds helped me process the concept of death, let alone the first player to be affected by it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/01/outer-wilds-ending-has-changed-the-way-i-think-about-death">A tangential comparison</a> of the in-game comet made of toxic material to a cancerous tumor really took me aback. My uncle Mike, who was almost like a second father, was living with lung cancer as I played through the game.</p>
<p>This facet of death, what to do with what&rsquo;s left of your life, is debilitating. Some are able to embrace it, check items off the bucket list, do what they set out to do. Others chase immortality, if not in corporeal form then by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjvs5Cs_5Q&t=89s">monuments to their name</a> and/or likeness. Mike&rsquo;s time, at least what of it I got to share with him, was more toward the first end of that spectrum. He joined the local Browns Backers chapter and watched football in a bar before the pandemic, and at his house during. He cooked all kinds of meat on his outdoor electric grill. He got into the last phase of the Marvel movies and the John Wick trilogy. Of course it was being there with him, yelling at the TV refs, modestly insisting that the chicken was too dry, and cracking up at Ragnarok, that&rsquo;s the forever stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different version of &ldquo;experiences, not things.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll never forget playing the scenario of a genie granting three wishes with a friend. Mine were juvenile, like a bajillion dollars, good looks, and another Jackass movie with the original cast. Her first wish was to be fluent in every language. Of course that would unlock the world in ways money can&rsquo;t, leading to authentic experiences that mean so much more. I don&rsquo;t remember the other two, that was enough to get me to change my outlook. Maximize authentic experiences, don&rsquo;t amass things, because the stories of what you did and what you learned are what&rsquo;s passed on to, and held by, the next. By next I mean those who stay behind, but who knows, maybe it&rsquo;s like the video game after all and they persist with whatever comes after for you as well.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the other facet of death, the what comes after. After finishing Outer Wilds, I stopped trying to figure that out. My grandpa Yesh passed away in 2018, years after a cancer diagnosis and many, many years after being born (but how many, we&rsquo;re not sure). One of his doctors told him &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t die <em>from</em> prostate cancer, you die <em>with</em> prostate cancer.&rdquo; So even though he was going through a rougher patch than usual that spring, I didn&rsquo;t cancel my flight across the country to attend my niece&rsquo;s first birthday party. When I left for the airport, I told him &ldquo;see you when I get back.&rdquo; He died the morning of my return flight.</p>
<p>It took a while, but I don&rsquo;t beat myself up about it. I could fill a book with memories of my grandpa Yesh. I still lapse into his accent and mannerisms when joking around with my family. I had moved to Florida the year before to be with him and make those extra memories. Not that being there at the exact moment would have been meaningless, but placing so much weight on the event itself does a disservice to the lifetime that preceded it.</p>
<p>My uncle Sonny passed away in 2019. I had moved into my grandpa&rsquo;s place, and Sonny lived in a unit one floor up. He could connect to our wifi and send stuff to our printer, and I would run it up to him. One day that fall I went up to drop off something someone else had printed for him, said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always downstairs if you need anything else,&rdquo; and left. There are more details, but they&rsquo;re not mine to tell, and a few days later he was gone.</p>
<p>The Hemingway line about bankruptcy happening <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/102579-how-did-you-go-bankrupt-two-ways-gradually-then-suddenly">&ldquo;gradually, then suddenly&rdquo;</a> may as well be about death. I&rsquo;ve thought about that a lot. Mike passed away this past March. He was declining at an accelerating pace, and people were coming in to spend time with him. A whole bunch of us got together at their place on a Sunday afternoon. Even though he was still cracking jokes and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOZndhz24OA&t=159s">Venom impressions</a>, I heard him whisper to my aunt Ceci at one point that there was &ldquo;too much energy.&rdquo; So we gathered our things and slid on our sandals. There were hugs and handshakes, but I hung by the door, not wanting to stir things up any more. I made eye contact with him across the room, and tried to send a glance that implied &ldquo;see you later.&rdquo; At least, I felt I got a similar glance back from him. He died the next morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this a couple days before his memorial service, so obviously I&rsquo;m still thinking about it. To have said a see you later to three close members of my family instead of a definitive goodbye ended up reinforcing my favorite memories of them, for months and years to come. So I don&rsquo;t regret it. Putting so much into death and the void afterwards takes away from the rich and long story leading up to it. And as trite as it may sound, a video game that appealed to all my regular video game sensibilities and ended with a surprise reckoning about death helped me understand that.</p>

<title>Cady Way &amp; Cross Seminole Trails</title>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=28.667987&lon=-81.30167&zoom=11.54">31.9 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/cwcs1.jpg" alt="Cross Seminole Trail" class="poster">
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Back to Orlando today with no extra gear &ndash; no gloves, no granola bars, no emergency phone battery &ndash; to tackle two more trails of similar distance under similar weather conditions. Only today I figured I would start a little later to give the day time to warm up. And you know what, it worked out just fine.</p>
<p>The first leg was along Cady Way trail, starting out of Druid Lake park. It contained two sub-parks, one for dogs and one for mountain bikes. You know, as the druids would have done. After a brief but hectic detour along city roads, it was back to a dedicated paved path around ponds and parks. Now, I like to look at maps, but I will admit to maybe not being able to read them that well. I have no idea what was going on near the end of this trail. Signs on behalf of Orange County kept wishing me well, then welcoming me back, and so on. So either the county border line or trail itself must go in a sawtooth pattern, despite what my amateur reading of the maps says. This repeated until the final crossing into Seminole County for good, when the trails switched over too.</p>
<p>The Cross Seminole trail followed a rather egregious east-west out and back. To get around what? The map suggests a high school, a golf course, and a couple gated communities, but again, perhaps I&rsquo;m reading it wrong. That&rsquo;s not to say it wasn&rsquo;t pleasant; the trail ran right through neighborhoods such that some houses along it had posts with address numbers or family names. It reminded me of the Filbert and Greenwich steps in San Francisco. Is that really your front door? Along a pedestrian walkway? How are your Amazon packages delivered?</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/cwcs2.jpg" alt="Trail End" class="left">Then I hit a section that was under construction. I mean, actively under construction. They were pouring cement right then and there. I kind of walked around the live construction zone and gingerly got back on the trail, half keeping an ear out for someone yelling at me, and half checking if the surface hadn&rsquo;t set yet. The rest was pretty much complete, fresh new asphalt without paint or signage. Although it was kind of hard to discern the whole situation because this segment ran through a series of construction yards. Were these people working on the trail, or was this just, like, their office? A set of railroad tracks bisected the as-of-yet-unpainted asphalt and it seemed like no one had any idea what to do about that. The path abruptly ended, so I picked up my board, walked up the berm, crossed the tracks, walked down the berm, and resumed.</p>
<p>I kept wondering why today didn&rsquo;t feel like an <em>adventure</em>, like I was blazing new ground or seeing new sights. And I realized that&rsquo;s not the point of greenways like these. They&rsquo;re meant to connect communities, that&rsquo;s why they go through so many backyards. I&rsquo;m just chasing the high of my first trip. The only stretch to feel alien and exciting was a long straightaway under rows of power lines. And I thought, that&rsquo;s a great idea, why don&rsquo;t we make more of these trails, there&rsquo;s always open area under power lines because people&hellip; don&rsquo;t&hellip; want to be there.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/cwcs3.jpg" alt="Power Lines" class="center">
<p>Back to reality, I reached where the Rails-to-Trails map said Cross Seminole would end, but it clearly kept going. So I rode for an extra mile, to where Google Maps&rsquo; bike view lost the trail. And yet, across the street from where I stopped, I could see another mile marker on the ground. Was it put there and later ripped up, implying the trail continued even farther, or was it waiting to be planted and set upright, once a future section was finished like what I had passed earlier? I decided I was done, so the trail must be too. Then when I got back and looked it up, Seminole County&rsquo;s interactive map showed it indeed continuing on from there all the way out of the dang county. Into the great undefined beyond of the map. Someone teach me cartography.</p>

<title>South Lake &amp; West Orange Trails</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/s-lake-w-orange.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=28.582323&lon=-81.646643&zoom=11.94">33.4 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/slwo1.jpg" alt="West Orange Trail" class="poster">
<p>The last time I drove north out of Palm Beach county was last February, to a wedding in Georgia. I only packed a suit to wear to the wedding itself and a change of clothes to sleep in, in addition to what I wore in the car. None of that was appropriate for cold weather, which is of course what awaited me a couple hours north in February. Today was more of the same. On a whim, I decided to wake up early, drive to Orlando, and ride two trails. The day before had been cold and windy at home, but I figured Florida is Florida and it would be warm enough.</p>
<p>Wrong. Overnight was iguana-dropping weather. It only ever got up into the mid-50s in the sun. And I didn&rsquo;t pack anything warm again beyond what I wore in the car. At least what I wore in the car is what I&rsquo;m likely to wear every day: a thin hoodie. So I layered that over my sweat-wicking (ha!) t-shirt and shorts, and skated most of the day with my hands in my pockets, because I don&rsquo;t even know if I own gloves anymore.</p>
<p>I began where the South Lake trail ends, somewhere west of Lake Minneola. And that trail ends abruptly like the Shel Silverstein sidewalk. But very quickly it began to hug the southern and eastern shores of the lake, swooping under trees with Spanish moss, and looking nothing like the palm-lined concrete avenues I&rsquo;ve walked the last year. It even darted through a historic village, complete with a World War II museum.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/slwo2.jpg" alt="Lake Minneola" class="center">
<p>Really, none of today felt like the Florida I know. There were hills! I took the first major downhill with a confidence born of ignorance, felt speed wobble for the first time in years, and immediately braked with my foot. On the next major downhill, I sat on the board and flew down like a luge, until again speed wobble made me panic-brake with my (raw) hands. Not great. On the third, I picked up the skateboard and walked. At least I maintained the strength of legs and conviction to skate every uphill the whole way.</p>
<p>One trail ends and the other begins at a nice little bike shop called Killarney Station (&ldquo;Please no bikes or skateboards on porch&rdquo;). The West Orange trail is about twice as long as South Lake, so the bike shop rest stop was only a third of the way through my total mileage. And this second part was definitely a lot more popular. Suddenly I was needing to weave around cyclists, joggers, and dogs. I saw many more people on roller skates than I could have expected, and I made two toddlers&rsquo; days. A guy with a helmet and mask almost completely obscuring his face, hands in pockets, gliding by on a big-wheeled skateboard? Might as well have been a muppet.</p>
<p>I also had the distinct anxiety of going past a high school as classes ended, and a middle school as the after-school period must&rsquo;ve ended. Which meant stopping and weaving through small cliques of kids crowded around a phone or walking three across. I bet they didn&rsquo;t find me as cool as the toddlers. The West Orange trail also has a fun stretch down the median of the main drag in Winter Garden. Never seen that before!</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/slwo3.jpg" alt="Forest Lake Golf Club" class="center">
<p>Between that stretch through a downtown and the final stretch, there was a nice segment through some woods and around the perimeter of a golf course. Most of the latter had tall chainlink awnings draped over the path, I guess to protect from any golf balls that way overshot the green. Wishful thinking, definitely only there as a confidence boost to the club members and not for legal reasons. I finally got comfortable carving back and forth on the downhills here, doing my best maple leaf. Or, yes, that one scene from Walter Mitty that I always think about.</p>
<p>The last section was essentially a sidewalk next to a busy street, with parks department funding to pave a little wider and smoother. I passed the trailhead where I&rsquo;d parked my car at the start of the day and considered stopping early. At this point my calves were sore and my hips were getting there, but I didn&rsquo;t want to be a quitter. If only there had been a sign.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/slwo4.jpg" alt="Rock Springs Rd" class="right">There actually were suddenly many little stop signs specifically for the trail, instructing pedestrians to stop at every driveway into stores and strip malls. There were also two roadside cross memorials. If only I had heeded their warning, because the trail ended rather unceremoniously at a major intersection. According to the lone trail marker, a new phase was planned, continuing north along the sidewalk. In my tired, sore, and hungry mood, I silently suggested that the parks department forget it. But in hindsight, even that part felt safer than a lot of other ground I&rsquo;ve covered. All in all, a pretty good day. I&rsquo;ll make sure to check the weather forecast next time.</p>

<title>El Rio Trail</title>

<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=26.401999&lon=-80.095233&zoom=13.49">4.8 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/ert1.jpg" alt="El Rio Trail" class="poster">
<p>This was a perfect ride. The weather was perfect: clear sunny sky, temperature in the high 60s, only the slightest breeze. The trail conditions were perfect: smooth pavement, always set far back from roads, with not many other people out and about. It was made even better that this was my first ride out with new tiny shock pads, which cut way down on board rattle. I didn&rsquo;t put on headphones, I simply kicked, pushed, and carved.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/ert2.jpg" alt="Iguana" class="right">A canal of the same name runs parallel to the trail through a variety of Boca Raton sights. Sometimes you&rsquo;re sandwiched between a canal and the backyard of a condo building, sometimes you&rsquo;re up against FAU open space with big campus buildings in the background. There are golf courses too, obviously. The trail pavement itself was always in good condition, with plenty of signage in case you somehow got lost maintaining a straight-ahead course. Giant green iguanas were often sunning themselves by the side of the path, then scurried away when I approached. There were some even bigger iguanas, orange instead, watching from a safe distance where scampering was unnecessary.</p>
<p>The trail was built in two stages, starting in 2008 and finishing in 2017. Some of the final segments were underpasses beneath the 95 and other busy roads. These were exciting to whoosh under, letting the increased speed of the downhill approach carry me through the cold wet underground air &mdash; the canal continued alongside through this underpass, naturally. It all brought back the feeling of coming down A1A in northern Florida. The trail was over too soon, ending unceremoniously at a major road leading into campus. I was plenty happy to turn around and experience it again, even with a mild headwind this time.</p>

<title>The Story of the 2020 NBA Finals</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/nba-finals-story.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;m not breaking any new ground when I say that the best sports moments are remembered because of their place in a good story. Some are even turned into movies, like Rudy or Brian&rsquo;s Song, and retold on the big screen. The underdog narrative is probably the most common feel-good story vehicle, though there have also been joyous breaking-the-curse moments, like the Red Sox in 2004 or the Cubs in 2016 &ndash; even though that one came at the expense of my beloved Cleveland baseball team.</p>
<p>Speaking of Cleveland sports, as I am wont to do, the Browns became the subject of national hype when they traded for Odell Beckham Jr. in advance of the 2019 season. He&rsquo;s a genuine superstar, one of the best at his position and a pop culture personality. The Browns already had a promising young quarterback and talent at other positions, so all of a sudden they were poised to reverse their own curse. But Nike, gifted in telling stories through their ad spots, celebrated instead by pointing out that Odell was reunited with his actual best friend Jarvis Landry, and they would finally be playing professional football for the same team. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcaIOgUDqXw">The commercial</a> is one of my favorites, and I would watch it before every game.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that the Browns season that followed was a bust. But they held onto Jarvis and Odell, and the story of best friends playing together has another opportunity for success. Though in Cleveland, the undisputed feel-good sports story of recent memory is LeBron James coming home to win the NBA Finals in 2016. There are so many elements to the story: LeBron grew up and became a superstar in Northeast Ohio, went straight from high school to the Cleveland Cavaliers, then left us for Miami where he finally got to win. But then he dumped Miami and came back! Not on a TV show but a magazine cover &ndash; see, he&rsquo;s learning! And after only two years back, he finally got to win in Cleveland, and he did it against the best basketball team in history. LeBron is the epicenter of those stories, as well he should be.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another element to that Cavs season. Their moves at the trade deadline brought in Channing Frye, uniting him with his friend Richard Jefferson. And their friendship was contagious, bringing the whole team together in a way that manifested on the court. That&rsquo;s why I was so excited for the Browns to get Odell. The stories outside the statistics and hometown tribalism make the best sports moments the best.</p>
<p>Now here we are at the 2020 NBA Finals: the LA Lakers versus the Miami Heat. It&rsquo;s almost certain this series will be talked about for years regardless of the outcome. And that&rsquo;s not accounting for the shortened season, the bubble, the state of the world coming into basketball. On Los Angeles&rsquo; side, there&rsquo;s the sudden and catastrophic death of Kobe Bryant earlier this year. A win for the Lakers is a win for Kobe and a win for the city, well deserved. On Miami&rsquo;s side, every player is a unique story unto himself, and I&rsquo;ll get back to this in a moment. Then you have the story of LeBron, now in LA, playing against a city he dumped, on the grandest stage. I agree with the sports writers calling this the story to watch, especially through the lens of <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2020/9/29/21493742/lakers-heat-finals-lebron-james-pat-riley">LeBron versus Heat president Pat Riley</a>.</p>
<p>No one expected Miami to make it this far this year except themselves. That&rsquo;s part of Riley&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29961927/nba-playoffs-be-cut-cloth-embodiments-miami-heat-culture">Heat culture</a>. LA has two headliners in LeBron and Anthony Davis. Miami is a team that&rsquo;s greater than the sum of its parts. Jimmy Butler is only in his first season with the team, but he&rsquo;s the anointed leader and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsppkoGXjbw">he&rsquo;ll tell you why</a>. Bam Adebayo is the ascending superstar, a Miami secret for the past few years and now breaking out nationally, as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJxSfxbE47c">seals a playoff game with his left wrist</a>. Tyler Herro is the rookie with the <a href="https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1310758158655270913">swagger of a champion</a>. Goran Dragi&cacute; and Andre Iguodala are turning back the clock. Udonis Haslem is Heat culture personified, leading huddles from the bench. And then there&rsquo;s Duncan Robinson.</p>
<hr>
<p>The brief summary of <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/9/17/21439778/duncan-robinson-miami-heat-boston-celtics-playoffs">the Duncan Robinson story</a> is, he was good, but somehow not good enough to demand your attention, until he was. He started at Division III Williams before transferring to Michigan. No NBA team drafted him, not even Miami. He worked his way up through tryouts and the G League to a starting role on the Heat and, more importantly, one of the best three point shooters in the sport. He&rsquo;s fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>On the day of the second game of the second round of the playoffs, ESPN published <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29707109/nba-playoffs-miami-heat-duncan-robinson-steps-sunlight">a profile</a> of Duncan, with the chief story element of him overcoming impostor syndrome. And who could blame him? Everything up until then would suggest that he didn&rsquo;t belong where he was, even despite his historic three point shooting ability. That in itself is worth examination: you don&rsquo;t have the monumental shift in importance of the three point shot without Steph Curry. He redefined basketball for this and future generations. Kids watching the NBA are working on their distance shooting because it&rsquo;s something anyone can do. Not everyone can be Shaq, 7 feet tall with hundreds of pounds of muscle, able to dunk for an automatic two points at will. Steph is (relatively) short and slender, and a two-time MVP. And his team didn&rsquo;t qualify for the bubble, so he was out of the picture for Duncan&rsquo;s star turn. It&rsquo;s not hard for a self-criticizing mind to wander down the path of, if the guy who paved the way for you to excel were here, would you still be in the spotlight for excelling?</p>
<p>And worse, in the games that followed the publication of that article, Duncan went cold (for him). His shots weren&rsquo;t falling as frequently, and he was getting into foul trouble early. That&rsquo;d be plenty of confirmation for someone with impostor syndrome: the stakes were getting higher and performance was getting lower. But Erik Spoelstra kept Duncan in the starting lineup. One great part of that profile is how Spoelstra himself had to overcome the feeling that he didn&rsquo;t deserve to be a coach. He started as the video guy for the team, the D3 school of the Heat organization. But he learned to believe in himself, as is the Heat way, and he still believed in Duncan &ndash; whose game, naturally, returned. He had a big game five in the conference finals, making layups that confounded the announcers who had never seen him attempt a shot inside the three point arc, and hustling on defense. He sank five threes in game six as the Heat made the Finals. And when he starts in game one tonight, he will be one of only ten people that qualify to do so. Top ten in the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything wise to offer about impostor syndrome. I&rsquo;ve definitely felt it. I worked at big internet companies in development-adjacent roles, rarely if ever writing code. Any programming I knew was largely self-taught, leagues below the guys (they were almost all guys) with years of professional experience and CS degrees. And the social hierarchy of the companies reflected that. Rather than get better, to justify my place and even rise into a role with prestige, I quit. The next big thing I sunk my life into was live comedy, which is full of the funniest people you know walking off stage and focusing on their mistakes. Even if the audience laughs, it&rsquo;s not enough until Lorne Michaels laughs, and from what I hear he&rsquo;s mute in those auditions.</p>
<p>On a video call with high school friends this summer, one of my buddies remarked that he was really impressed with the stuff I did with computers when we were kids. Now he&rsquo;s a professional programmer. My impostor syndrome patterns from years ago would&rsquo;ve seized on the fact that he overtook me in ability, further proving I had no place doing what I was doing. But instead it was empowering, because he still thought about me that way enough to remember it as so. It&rsquo;s not the same as your coach sticking by you when you may not believe in yourself, but it&rsquo;s gotta be related. The strength and inspiration to break out of that spiral really can come from anywhere.</p>
<p>Duncan Robinson is the story of the 2020 NBA Finals for me. I&rsquo;ll be watching for him, rooting for him, and happy for him if Miami wins. Shoot, as a current South Florida guy, I&rsquo;ll be happy for the city of Miami. And if LA wins, I&rsquo;ll be happy for them too. Overjoyed for LeBron. There are so many good stories to follow.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=26.729416&lon=-80.040096&zoom=13.7">4.5 miles</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/lt1.jpg" alt="Lake Trail" class="left">I moved to West Palm Beach at the start of this month, and soon thereafter incorporated a segment of the Lake Trail into my daily run. That southern segment between bridges still goes by a lot, including the Flagler museum, the giant kapok tree, and the Breakers golf course. I waited for a lazy sunny weekend to see what the rest of the so-called Trail of Conspicuous Consumption offered.</p>
<p>The answer was, kind of more of the same. A smooth paved trail on the western shore of Palm Beach island, uninterrupted by car traffic. As you ride north, the intracoastal is always immediately to your left, and hedge fences hiding mansions are immediately to your right. There are a handful of historical plaques, always seeming to describe the adjacent building as the oldest hotel in Florida. Except for the one for the oldest church.</p>
<p>After winding around a country club or two, the trail ends unceremoniously up by the Palm Beach inlet. You can amble through a residence to the ocean, or turn around and double back. I definitely appreciate that this is a nice, protected trail, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ride the full length of it many more times. It did make me once again consider living on a boat when I retire, though.</p>

<title>Pastecard State of the Company, 2020</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/pastecard-sotc-2020.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to be an app?</li>
<li>Are people starting to take this seriously?</li>
<li>This company is probably $200 in the red</li>
</ul>
<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>Pastecard formally launched in Q4 2010 in Palo Alto, California. In Q1 2018, the company moved its headquarters <em>yet again</em> to Jupiter, Florida and is still happily operating there. Employees were not given relocation bonuses, but were encouraged to take advantage of Florida&rsquo;s zero income tax on their zero income.</p>
<h3>Staff</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brian Sutorius,</strong> UX</li>
<li><strong>Hudson the koala puppet, </strong> Chairman of the Board</li>
</ul>
<h2>Product</h2>
<p>The Pastecard app was only available on the web for the first seven years (including bookmark-installs to iPhone home screens). Developing for the web ensured that Pastecard would work as well as possible on any platform the company couldn&rsquo;t test on&mdash;that is, everything other than an iPhone.</p>
<p>In late 2017, work began on a completely native iPhone app. Initially, there were no benefits other than the smug satisfaction of another line item on the developer&rsquo;s resume. And soon after the first version of that app was finished, the focus went back to the original web app for a complete rewrite that made it slightly more respectable. The two coexisted, on company phones, in complete parity.</p>
<p>The Apple ecosystem being what it is, it was relatively easy to expand the native iPhone app into one that worked on the iPad as well. Both gained Share Extensions that are only available to native apps, creating an advantage. A functioning proof-of-concept Apple Watch app followed shortly thereafter. And now the product is bifurcated in a complicated way, since the native apps aren&rsquo;t available through traditional App Stores.</p>
<p>The company is keeping a close watch on The Light Phone II as yet another platform for which to develop a native app. And the point must be made that each native app is only ever expected to have at most one (1) user. Perhaps this is commentary more on the industry than a single company&mdash;that web apps are increasingly less relevant and crowded out&mdash;but either way it is entirely too serious for this report.</p>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li>YAU <em>(yearly active users)</em> in 2019: <strong>4</strong></li>
<li>New users in 2019: <strong>2</strong></li>
<li>Ad impressions in 2019: <strong>hard zero</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>As part of GDPR compliance in 2018, the company no longer captures any personal information about active users, including their email addresses. Therefore, it is hard to say whether the two new users in 2019 were test accounts that the developer forgot to delete later, or real human beings. The prospect that actual people are discovering and signing up for the app is worrisome, and hoped not to continue.</p>
<h2>Financials</h2>
<h3>Operating Expenses</h3>
<p>The company pays approximately $12 each year to maintain its domain name registration, its only operating expense. However, the company has switched domain registrars much more frequently than is recommended, each time paying for an additional year beyond the current registration. This confounding bit of accounting makes it hard to keep track of in which year a particular year&rsquo;s worth of registration is paid for. As a result, the company&rsquo;s total expenses since inception are on the books as roughly $167, but likely to be a couple multiples of $12 higher.</p> 
<p>Outside consulting firms have been retained to draw up an employee compensation plan, but said firms have not been compensated themselves and have understandingly been reluctant to share their proposals.</p>
<h3>Revenue</h3>
<p>The company considered an elaborate scheme built on a flawed sequence of sociopolitical memes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The poor understanding of the <em>Citizens United</em> ruling that corporations are people</li>
<li>That people rely on GoFundMe campaigns to cover outrageous healthcare costs</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea was to set up a corporate GoFundMe to cover the bleeding out of expenses, quickly abandoned because the company is not even properly incorporated. Pastecard has never made any money, and it looks like it will continue that way forever.</p>
<h4>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL</h4>
<p>The company has long thought about offering &ldquo;Pastecard Pro&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pastecard+&rdquo; accounts as a revenue stream. Proposed benefits include proprietary automatic URL shortening (so more links can be saved to a user&rsquo;s card) and white-glove assistance with installing a native app to a user&rsquo;s device. Obviously, the benefits of such an account should be commensurate with its cost. Pricing is anticipated to be $24.99/month.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>I listened more to podcasts and talk radio than music these last ten years. I still love music, even if my tastes haven&rsquo;t broadened much. I know what I like, and I&rsquo;ll get to that in a minute. At least some podcasts are <em>about</em> music. You probably know <a href="https://songexploder.net">Song Exploder</a>, which is excellent. <a href="https://switchedonpop.com/">Switched on Pop</a> can also be really good, and you have them to blame for any musical terminology I grossly misuse in the following paragraphs. Closer to home for me are certain episodes of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-sound-and-the-story/id1088695810">The Sound and the Story</a>, or the multi-episode run about Hellogoodbye on <a href="https://www.stereoconfidential.com/">Stereo Confidential</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I listen to so much talk, the songs I put on repeat were mostly because of their melodic elements. The era of loving songs for lyrics you can put in an away message is over (in no small part because <a href="https://aimemories.tumblr.com/post/166091776077/aimemories">AIM shut down this decade</a> too). When I sing along in the car, it's more humming along with the hook. And I think that's the common thread between these songs, presented in chronological order instead of a top ten countdown:</p>
<h2>Robyn &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ7u6mIFWTQ">Dancing On My Own</a> (2010)</h2>
<p>We played this song together the night I moved in with Brandon and Vinny, trading between guitar, bass, and drums, and we didn't need to practice much before jamming all the way through. The bones of it are simple, the stylistic finishes make it a standout. I especially enjoy the sound effect used instead of a cymbal crash after each chorus, it reminds me of LP3-era Ratatat.</p>
<h3>see also Fifth Harmony &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GL9JoH4Sws">Work from Home</a> (2016)</h3>
<p>The entire melody is seven notes, played in the same sequence over and over, by all the different instruments. It&rsquo;s like the upside-down (rightside-up?) version of Seven Nation Army. Has any other pop song ever done so much with so little? Only half kidding.</p>
<h2>The Gaslight Anthem &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEH1Y60f_sA">45</a> (2012)</h2>
<p>Every Gaslight Anthem review must mention that Brian Fallon is the next Springsteen. Whether he is or isn&rsquo;t, this <em>is</em> rock and roll. I find myself looping the outro, where Fallon does a call and response with the lead guitar. He changes the way he sings his line, and the guitar melody matches.</p>
<h2>The 1975 &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKIhXi-yiw8">Sex</a> (2013)</h2>
<p>One of my two favorite bands of the decade, changing their style to keep pace with my changing taste. Or was it the other way around? From the too-cool opening line &ldquo;and this is how it starts,&rdquo; the song feels like it wants to exist in the beat <em>after</em> the one coming out of the speakers. It&rsquo;s consistently moving forward, it&rsquo;s plaintive, it&rsquo;s excellent.</p>
<h3>see also The 1975 &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bVJFgvUZHg">It&rsquo;s Not Living (If It&rsquo;s Not With You)</a> (2019)</h3>
<p>The first twenty seconds of this song, on the other hand, are so bright. Combined with the title, it sets itself up to be one of the all-time great love songs. Alas, the titular &ldquo;you&rdquo; is heroin.</p>
<h2>Limbeck &ndash; <a href="https://limbeck.bandcamp.com/track/million-years">Million Years</a> (2016)</h2>
<p>This song is an anachronism. First, it&rsquo;s a fresh Limbeck track released almost a decade after their last album. It feels like a trip back even farther to their mid-2000s apex as twang-aspiring labelmates of pop punk juggernauts. The dopey space lyrics appeal to me, especially delivered via their trademark harmonies. And I&rsquo;m always a sucker for the singer segueing to the guitar solo. Second, it&rsquo;s a standalone single with a purchase price in the era of subscription streaming services. The proceeds went to cover healthcare costs of the original artist. A real sign of the times.</p>
<h2>The Naked And Famous &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCsyXSr7u-Q">Higher</a> (2016)</h2>
<p>Call this the platonic ideal of my musical taste this decade: a driving beat, electronic flair, and little staccato melodies sprinkled throughout. I sing along to the hook that plays after the &ldquo;higher, higher&rdquo; in the chorus and the digital whirs after that, instead of the lyrics. Their three full length albums all arrived this decade and there are high moments in each of them. This one was the most consistently enjoyable.</p>
<h2>CHVRCHES &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDSVLQoPc8w">Graffiti</a> (2018)</h2>
<p>My other favorite band of the decade, who also released their three full length albums in this ten year span. Even though I think there were fewer good songs on the most recent one, what good songs there were, were truly <em>great</em>. Replacing digital drum kits with a live drummer evens out their sound, and Lauren Mayberry has real oomph behind her voice. It all makes for my favorite track of theirs, and that's a difficult choice to make.</p>
<h3>see also CHVRCHES &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHxwSp-6Og">Empty Threat</a> (2015)</h3>
<p>A very close second, only held back by a slight downer of a bridge. At least it ramps back up into the final chorus at full energy. I also have a particular fondness for this video after first watching it over weak WiFi in a hotel room in India with my brothers and cousins.</p>    
<h2>Charly Bliss &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yayHHmUxs">Capacity</a> (2019)</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s convenient for me that this is the most recent song on the list, so it can slot in where the traditional #1 pick would go. It&rsquo;s likely recency bias at play, but as I write this, Capacity is my favorite song of the decade. I have yet to skip it when it comes on shuffle. This song has everything. The beat is simple and consistent. There&rsquo;s a little arpeggiated guitar melody layered under the verse vocals, which drifts in and out of being in sync with the vocal melody. The reverb guitar chord that transitions the song from verse to chorus hits hard every time, and is even matched to a scene cut in the video. Some fans of their first album were disappointed with the direction this song took, in an apparent veer away from &ldquo;what if blue album Weezer were fronted by a woman?&rdquo; To them, I point out that this song has a simple, silly guitar solo that I air-guitar along to, just like Buddy Holly. And after that, a bridge that I actually like! The clean strumming is an effective break, and then it doubles upon itself as the vocals do the same, each line punctuated with pounding on a bass drum. Finally, the lyrics are destined for retweets here at the turbulent end of this decade: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at capacity / I&rsquo;m spilling out of me.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Rickenbacker Trail</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/rickenbacker-trail.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=25.708735&lon=-80.161117&zoom=12.86">9 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rt1.jpg" alt="Rickenbacker Trail" class="poster">
<p>This trip began shortly after sunrise on Miami&rsquo;s M Path, part of my old friend the East Coast Greenway. It had rained overnight and was still intermittently drizzling, but nothing so bad as to cancel plans. A few quick blocks brought me to the tollbooth for the Rickenbacker Causeway and the William M Powell bridge. Due to equal parts morning laziness and a slight fear (let&rsquo;s say <em>respect</em>) of slick wet pavement, I walked the bridge&rsquo;s incline. One of the great parts about this trail is that there&rsquo;s a separate protected lane or sidewalk the entire distance, so you don&rsquo;t have to take the green shoulder bike lane. Including the bridge!</p>
<p>From the apex, I could see all the way to the end of Key Biscayne, under dark and ominous clouds. The little weather app promised everything would be clear by the time I got there, so I pushed on. The sidewalk route through Crandon Park is actually its parking lot, but there was absolutely nobody there early in the morning. Then onto city sidewalks through the village of Key Biscayne and finally into Bill Baggs State Park. I did not have correct change ($2) to put in one of the traditional envelopes for hikers and bikers, so I went right up to the car toll window like a dummy and had him swipe my card.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rt2.jpg" alt="Cape Florida Lighthouse" class="right">Each leg of this trail flashed by quicker than I expected, and the segment from the park entrance to the lighthouse at the southern tip was the quickest. It was beautiful to skate along the coastline for a bit, and even catch a glimpse of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/bisc/learn/historyculture/stiltsville.htm">Stiltsville</a> far off on the horizon. Of course, when I reached the lighthouse, perfectly timed for its opening at 9AM, I learned that it is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, i.e. no entrance to climb to the top. While a bummer, that combined with my early arrival meant no one else was there. Approaching the lighthouse down the palm-lined path, perfectly quiet and serene, was exceedingly cool.</p>
<p>On the way back, I decided to try the painted green bike lanes off the shoulder of the main road, and immediately regretted not having done so for the way down. I swear that the thick coat of paint makes the asphalt smoother, filling in its usually coarse texture. It felt like skating on glass. And I was never concerned that some Porsche or Maserati would sideswipe me from behind. I made it back in significantly less time, stopping only to admire the abandoned <a href="https://www.marinestadium.org">Miami Marine Stadium</a>.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rt3.jpg" alt="Marine Stadium" class="center">
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t bright broad daylight and I wasn&rsquo;t wearing a bright safety yellow shirt, I would&rsquo;ve tried to break in. The west side still has original cement stairs leading up to a shoddy barricade, as opposed to the chain-link fence surrounding the rest of the property. But they have at least one security guard watching from the similarly-graffiti-covered ticket booth, and who knows how many more. The art was incredible though.</p>
<p>And here is where I hoped to transition into the second trail of the day, but I ran into security there as well. A park ranger at Shark Valley stopped me right before I put my board on the pavement, and angrily reminded me that skateboards are prohibited in all national parks. It had taken me over an hour to drive due west on Tamiami Trail into the heart of the Everglades, and I got a little angry back at him, challenging him on why bikes were deemed safe enough and skateboards weren&rsquo;t. His reply, word for word, was &ldquo;Because then it&rsquo;d be like a beach out there, with skateboards, and roller blades, and scooters!&rdquo; There was no fighting this guy. I rented a clunky cruiser bike and traveled the trail that way. It felt like going running with your Fitbit still at home &mdash; I don&rsquo;t get credit for those <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/tram-road.htm">15 miles</a>, since they weren&rsquo;t by skateboard. But I did get to see a bunch of cool wildlife, like a heron picking up a snake in its beak and flying away, giant grasshoppers, and dozens of <a href="https://myfwc.com/research/freshwater/species-assessments/mollusks/apple-snails/">Florida Apple Snail</a> shells abandoned by the path. And when I finally saw an alligator, mere feet away, it was all worth it.</p>

<title>Classic Mac</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/classic/</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://bsuto.com/classic/toasters.gif" alt="Classic Mac" class="hero">
<p>I co-hosted <a href="https://simplebeep.com">a podcast</a> about the era of the classic Mac, and long wanted a fun way to run software from then. First there was an old G3 iBook, then an OS 9 emulator on a MacBook Air. This project is a marriage of both: the charm of classic hardware with the convenience of modern hardware and software.</p>
<p>Which classic Mac to use was a no-brainer: there&rsquo;s literally a model <em>named</em> Macintosh Classic, one of the final revisions of the iconic all-in-one design. I found one on eBay &ldquo;for parts only&rdquo;, since it had <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/burn.jpg" class="tip">caught fire</a> the last time its owner turned it on. During the course of this project, I read many forum posts angry at anyone who dared to ruin one of these relics that still had a chance of being restored. My conscience is clear that I avoided such an ethical dilemma.</p>
<p>Taking the Classic apart wasn&rsquo;t too difficult, and there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nguN392TH-g">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnQXqRjrCc">videos</a> online to show you how. You need a long <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0O17A">T15 Torx screwdriver</a> to remove the two screws under the top handle, and make sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfook04k1kM">discharge the CRT</a> before mucking around in there. The motherboard, floppy drive, and hard drive are all very easy to remove. The CRT and vertically-mounted analog board are only slightly more complex. I used a flat-tip screwdriver to pry the analog board off its metal frame, preserved the power switch, and screwed that vertical frame back into the main chassis. Then I used that screwdriver to <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/chip.jpg" class="tip">chisel off the plastic caps</a> securing the fan carriage.</p>
<p>At this point, I had an empty case with its full metal chassis. The exterior was a little yellow from however many years of sun exposure, so I researched a couple <em>retr0bright</em> recipes before finding a <a href="https://happymacs.wordpress.com/2016/09/07/yellowing-retr0bright-and-sally-beauty-supply/">blog post</a> saying off-the-shelf <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OKDW20">40 Volume Creme Developer</a> from Sally Beauty Supply works just as well. I painted a thin layer on the case exterior with a foam brush and <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/retrobright.jpg" class="tip">let it dry</a> in direct sunlight for a little over an hour, wiped the residue off with a paper towel, and it looked good as new.</p>
<p>The display was the most difficult part of the whole project. This <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hdmi-8-lcd-screen-kit-1024x768">8&rdquo; LCD panel</a> is a common choice because it&rsquo;s closest to the original display&rsquo;s dimensions with the correct aspect ratio. The wonderful Eric at the Palm Beach Gardens Michael&rsquo;s cut me a piece of acrylic to cover the front and some black matte to align it from behind. I layered them on top of a piece of cardboard and sealed <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/display.jpg" class="tip">the whole sandwich</a> together with some electric tape. Next, I epoxied a 3D-printed <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3551263">gap filler</a> to the curved opening where the CRT formerly was, and epoxied the acrylic side of the display sandwich directly to that. If you&rsquo;re more confident than I was, you could drill holes into the corners of your display sandwich and screw it into the mounting points left behind by the CRT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild how the current form factor of the Mac mini <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/fit.jpg" class="tip">fits perfectly</a> into the lower area of the metal chassis. I got a mid-2011 model so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with an optical drive, swapped its hard disk for an SSD, and installed the latest version of macOS it supports (10.13 High Sierra). Its built-in speaker is pretty bad, so I got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DDGBL5T">USB-powered ones</a> and mounted them to the top side of the metal chassis. The only special considerations left to make are some 90&deg; cables: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1TRL1V">left-angled USB</a> (to power the speakers and display), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QV6Y0X0">HDMI</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C4FU52C">audio</a>. I threaded a third 90&deg; USB extender cable through to the disk slot on the front, for if I ever need a USB port.</p>
<p>As for power, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LBV4NJ4/">90&deg; adapter</a> plugged into a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GNWLX9/">C7 to C14 converter cable</a>, with the C14 socket affixed to where it originally was on the analog board frame. Any old monitor power cable plugs in from here to the wall. The ADB port on the back more or less aligns with the Mac mini&rsquo;s power button, so for now I have <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/back.jpg" class="tip">a beige plastic bolt</a> sticking out that I fumble around to hit it. A more elegant solution would obviously be nice.</p>
<p>From there, you have a modern macOS machine <a href="https://bsuto.com/classic/inside.jpg" class="tip">fully self-contained</a> in a classic Mac case. For a layer of extra polish, swap out the Torx screws for regular Phillips ones as you put it back together: (4x) #8 x 1/2&rdquo; to connect the chassis to the front face, and (2x) #8-32 x 3/4&rdquo; by the ports. I decided to leave the ones under the top handle out altogether, but they&rsquo;re (2x) #8 x 3/4&rdquo; if you want them. And to go full classic Mac, install <a href="https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver_mac_os_x_setup">SheepShaver</a> or <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">mini vMac</a> and get lost in the <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org">Macintosh Garden</a>.</p>

<title>Happy Surprises</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/happy-surprises.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I have been a user and a fan of Panic&rsquo;s software for almost 20 years. What drew me in was <a href="https://panic.com/extras/audionstory/">an MP3 player in the time before iTunes</a>, which came with audio effects like magically muting the vocal track to put any Limewire download into karaoke mode, and fantastical themes that were translucent like the iMac they were running on. It was a dependable app with delightful details I hadn&rsquo;t expected.</p>
<p>Their two co-founders have always exhibited the same style online, whether in official company blog posts or personal Twitter accounts. Both were among the first people I followed when I joined Twitter; my fandom for their company preceded Web 2.0. And I think this is the secret to Panic&rsquo;s success: both its employees and its products do what they set out to do very well and add an unexpected element of delight on top.</p>
<p>This brings me to <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>, their recently-announced but not-yet-on-sale portable video game console. Plenty of people have already written anticipatory odes of joy, so I won&rsquo;t do that here. I want to emphasize the whole reason it exists: Panic wanted to bring happy surprises into the world. The console itself was a big surprise &ndash; no one expected a bright yellow Game Boy from the company that makes an <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">FTP client</a> &ndash; and the only reason they announced it before it was available to purchase was they scored a <a href="https://play.date/edge/">magazine cover</a>. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m sure they would have kept the whole thing a secret until it was an overnight shipment away. Their initial lineup of games is still a secret, to be revealed one by one, a week at a time, after you first turn your Playdate on. The plan is for players to be happily surprised every Monday morning for twelve weeks.</p>
<p>Is this a viable business model? I don&rsquo;t know! The first twelve games are included with the console itself, so there&rsquo;s no subscription-type payment structure to serve as an <em>unwelcome</em> surprise every week. I&rsquo;ve studied Dan Ariely long enough to know the concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCujWv7Mc8o">the pain of paying</a>. What I do know is that happy surprises are, and should be, a viable model of human behavior.</p>
<hr>
<p>While I spend my days doing stuff on computers, including regular use of the aforementioned FTP client, I spend many of my nights and weekends at improv theaters. Improv comedy is one long string of happy surprises, for both the performers and the audience. And yet, it took me way too many years to realize that &ldquo;happy surprises&rdquo; are a solid way for me to approach it. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m good at it, or that it&rsquo;ll work for everyone, only that it&rsquo;s a theory that recently crystalized.</p>
<p>All of comedy is surprise. Punch lines succeed when you don&rsquo;t see them coming. Most of the time, these surprises delight us and make us laugh. Other times, as with shock comedy, we react with disbelief &ndash; which still can manifest as a laugh! Or, with fresh observational or absurdist comedy, we&rsquo;re surprised at something truly new to us and, especially at a live show, we laugh in a shared realization.</p>
<p>So much improv comedy is two-person scenes. And as any improv teacher will tell you, one of the fundamentals of such scenes is the relationship between those two people. Not only how each knows the other, but how each feels about the other. And I feel like, anecdotally at least, a lot of those in-the-moment relationships are variations on &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this person.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m guilty of it too! Lots of unrequited love scenes, competition scenes, and straight up antagonistic conflicts. All of this is to say is that when you&rsquo;re already in a negative mind frame, the inevitable surprises that happen when you&rsquo;re making up the scene as you go are more liable to anger you.</p>
<p>Angry outbursts lead to easy laughs. There&rsquo;s a whole genre of loud man-child comedy from Dane Cook to Danny McBride to Tim Robinson that&rsquo;s been wildly successful. Similarly, a cynical or offended position in observational standup is an easy path to laughter. The stereotypical Seinfeld &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the deal with X&rdquo; setup exists to deliver to a punchline about how X stinks, not how X is wonderful. And it&rsquo;s funny when things stink. The word <em>stink</em> is funny. Also, who doesn&rsquo;t love a good takedown of something that well and truly stinks? It&rsquo;s the very heartbeat of Twitter, both in ways that make us laugh and make us sit back and think.</p>
<p>But &ndash; and here&rsquo;s my most useless sentence in the whole thing &ndash; there&rsquo;s enough negativity out there already. In the news obviously, and also in comedy performances. So I&rsquo;ve been trying to make concerted efforts to react to surprising moments with wonder and delight. I think it makes my characters more appealing, and in the best cases it helps push the scenes forward. If the other person wants to continue a conflict, me being saccharine is actually more effective than directly fighting back. If not, now there&rsquo;s hopefully a little more joy on stage.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this all down after listening to <a href="https://www.earwolf.com/episode/hannah-gadsby/">Conan O&rsquo;Brien interview Hannah Gadsby</a>. Her special <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611">Nanette</a> deserves its wide recognition, both for the content of her message and her insights into comedy vis-&agrave;-vis tension and anger. In the second half of the podcast episode, they talk about how easy it is to take the angry stance in comedy, using the example of getting peanuts on an airplane that you didn&rsquo;t want. What struck me, while unsaid by them, is how that example is a nice counterpart to one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUBtKNzoKZ4">Louis CK&rsquo;s first viral routines</a> (also with Conan!): why are we angry about anything on an airplane when their existence is a miracle?</p>
<p>Of course, we consider Louis CK very differently now, and I don&rsquo;t want to hold him up as something to emulate. Instead, how about Will Ferrell in Elf? The world outside of the North Pole is a series of surprises to him and he reacts with glee to each one, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlqNar4AmuQ">pneumatic mail tubes</a>. Or, even better, a golden retriever. I&rsquo;ve never had one of my own so I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I am pretty certain they are always happy and every new thing they experience only makes them happier. Think of the first time you throw your golden puppy a tennis ball, and how excited they are to play catch. The first time! By contrast, I have had pet hedgehogs and the first / every time I rolled a tiny tennis ball toward them, they hated it. Also, <a href="https://vetstreet-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/51/3d/7a22f69c46f587a6730c36b2c2b1/golden-retriever-ap-zfje1k-645.jpg">golden retrievers always look like they are smiling</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, in improv, in comedy, and in life: be a golden retriever. Find the joy and delight in things that surprise you. Panic&rsquo;s next game for other consoles is about a <a href="https://goose.game">goose</a>; I hope one of the first Playdate games is about a dog.</p>

<title>Light versus Heavy</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/light-vs-heavy.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>For as long as I can remember, the majority of my work (including schoolwork) has more often than not required a computer. And so, a desktop or a laptop computer has been where I do all my heavy work. Advancements in smartphones and tablets have made it possible for a lot of people, even technically-minded people whose work may demand a more serious computer, to shift their heavy work to a mobile device. And maybe one day I&rsquo;ll get there too, but I don&rsquo;t see it happening soon.</p>
<p>I still treat my phone as a supplementary device to the main computer in many ways. For one, I treat my phone camera like it&rsquo;s a standalone digital camera. I plug the phone into the computer with a cable like a luddite, transfer the photos to the computer, and delete them off the phone. For another, I still download new music on my computer, organize playlists in iTunes, and then transfer them to the phone. The phone is relieved from doing this so-called heavy work, which is dumb because modern streaming models are designed for phones and actually very light and easy.</p>
<p>So the phone should be a light device for me. Whenever I want to do something time-intensive, I choose the computer. And yet, I spend so much time on the phone because I am addicted to it like so many of us. So I do some of the well-known tricks, like turning off notifications &ndash; the only apps that can make my phone buzz are Phone, Messages, Calendar, and Venmo<sup><a href="#fn-1-lvh" id="fr-1-lvh">1</a></sup>. Everything else requires me to open the app or website and refresh. But the phone is still heavy in other ways.</p>
<p>One of which is its literal weight. I use the iPhone XR, which is excellent, but also the biggest and heaviest thing I&rsquo;ve ever carried around on a constant basis. And because it is so excellent at all the things it can do, having it on hand makes it very compelling to start doing them, even if they don&rsquo;t buzz their way into my attention. So I&rsquo;ve started looking for something even lighter than the iPhone for times like going running or quick errands. My reduced set of needs for a light device are eerily similar to <a href="https://bsuto.com/articles/airplane-mode.html">an introspection I wrote in 2011</a>, when I was thinking about ways to reduce my phone usage because the monthly bill was too high. Here in 2019, I&rsquo;d like my light device to send and receive text messages, play podcasts, access Pastecard, and maybe give GPS directions.</p>
<p>Option 1, and the transparent inspiration for the title and structure of this article, is <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2/x/18240044#/">The Light Phone 2</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a tiny Kindle that does phone stuff instead of books. I enthusiastically joined its crowdfunding campaign and look forward to getting it this summer. On paper, it does (or will do in the near future) everything on my list of requirements. The Light team promises to have a straightforward SDK, so even if it doesn&rsquo;t come with an app for playing MP3s, someone else will make one. And I&rsquo;m dedicated to making a Pastecard app for it, if only for myself.</p>
<p>However, in practice, I can already foresee that it won&rsquo;t be seamless to &ldquo;go light&rdquo;, as they call it. And that&rsquo;s my fault, not theirs. I&rsquo;m firmly entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, primarily through iMessage. Swapping my SIM card between the iPhone and the Light Phone is probably going to cause a few headaches in how iMessages will be delivered, to say nothing of the &ldquo;(name) laughed at (previous message)&rdquo; text messages I&rsquo;ll sign myself and everyone else up for. Less obtrusive but still not easy will be manually obtaining and loading the MP3 files for podcasts I want to listen to, losing my place in my phone podcast app in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>This brings me to option 2, an Apple Watch. That very neatly and completely solves the iMessage problem of the Light Phone.<sup><a href="#fn-2-lvh" id="fr-2-lvh">2</a></sup> And seamless integration with an iPhone podcast app is certainly possible too: Apple&rsquo;s own app and Overcast both allow you to leave the iPhone at home and resume listening where you left off. But I would really prefer for <a href="http://www.supertop.co/castro/">Castro</a> to make their Watch app standalone. And I would certainly make a native Watch app for Pastecard.</p>
<p>Regardless, I will have a Light Phone in hand by the end of the summer. And if Castro releases a standalone Watch app, I will have an Apple Watch on wrist by the end of the following day. And one of those have a good chance of becoming my new light device. The phone will become some kind of middleweight, and the computer remains the heavy workhorse.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me go back to push notifications, arguably one of the biggest factors in keeping people addicted to their phones. When I used dating apps, I kept notifications on because of course I don&rsquo;t want to miss any matches or messages from potential dates. But the apps would also send bogus re-engagement notifications like &ldquo;SOMEONE swiped right on you&rdquo; or &ldquo;There&rsquo;s increased activity in your area&rdquo; or &ldquo;We set up a featured match for you&rdquo; and those ruined the experience.<sup><a href="#fn-3-lvh" id="fr-3-lvh">3</a></sup> While turning all notifications off doesn&rsquo;t wholly remove the temptation of getting lost in your apps and feeds, it certainly helps. So here&rsquo;s a free but impossible app idea.</p>
<p>Call it Pull Notifications. The app is just a single view that shows all your linked services (Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Slack, etc.) and how many notifications you have waiting in each &ndash; the number that each service&rsquo;s app <em>would have</em> in a red bubble. You tap the service&rsquo;s icon to go to their app, and deal with it as you would. This lets you turn off notifications in all those apps and also reduces the desire to open them just to see if there&rsquo;s anything waiting for you, which ultimately leads to more time wasting. And Pull Notifications never buzzes your phone on their behalf either. You have to open the app and pull or tap to refresh all their numbers.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the one design detail I&rsquo;d love to see, and it does require enabling notifications for the app in settings (but only badges). The app icon is a flat <span style="color:#DA0101;">#DA0101</span> red, the same shade as the red iOS badge, with a white circle cutout at the upper right corner. The Pull Notifications app itself can badge its icon with a number, representing the total of all the notifications awaiting you inside, but even that number blends in as part of the icon rather than demanding your attention on top of it.</p>
<p>Like I said though, this is more or less impossible given the current landscape of data sharing on the Internet. Services like Facebook Messenger have never provided a clean way of surfacing the unread count of your inbox, and services like Twitter and Instagram have removed those options from their ever-shrinking API methods. And more importantly, I don&rsquo;t see why anyone would rightly trust a single app, even one with good intentions and a strong privacy policy, to have access to all their services. But really, I just want it for that icon-badge integration.</p>

<title>Long Term Items</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/long-term-items.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Odes to things that have lasted an unexpectedly long time despite constant use. When so many of my other things are disposed of or replaced increasingly frequently, it&rsquo;s nice to remember these.</p>
<h2>Black Mountain Sports Backpack</h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/backpack.jpg" alt="Black Mountain Sports Backpack" class="right">
<p><strong>Summer 2003 &ndash; November 2014: </strong>Perhaps the consumer item that most defines me is a backpack. I prefer them to any other kind of bag, and I am always looking for a better one &mdash; whether for a specific purpose like long-distance skateboarding, weekend travel, taking a laptop to a coworking space, or one that generally satisfies any purpose. Before I started college in the fall of 2003, I was gifted this wholly generic backpack. The label said Black Mountain Sports, which has no official record anywhere on the Internet. I think it was a Costco house brand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to point out how ugly it was. But it sure was functional. I learned to pack certain things in certain pockets: the top exterior pocket was for small essentials like gum or sunglasses, or even an iPod. The bottom exterior pocket was for larger essentials like a charger or toiletry case (see below!). One side pocket was a traditional mesh water bottle pocket with a cinch cord, which I used as intended. The other side pocket was like a cargo shorts pocket with a Velcro flap. I never used this. The thinner main compartment had built-in fabric separators for school supplies and papers; this is where I put those things or a plastic bag with dirty clothes at the end of the trip. The <em>main</em> main compartment was for clean clothes and a laptop in the laptop sleeve.</p>
<p>I packed this bad boy the same way every time for the better part of a decade. I didn&rsquo;t take it on many trips, likely because I was either a full-time student or full-time employed for most of the time I owned it. But its zippers never failed, the straps never broke, and it always did the job.</p>
<p>An honorable mention goes to its replacement and my current all-purpose backpack, the <a href="https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/2306526/incase-designs-campus-compact-backpack?color=ORANGE-STORM%20BLUE">Incase Campus Compact</a>. This is rated at only 20L of capacity, and its two side water bottle pockets are useless. They expand into the main compartment, rather than with a stretchy fabric outward. But its simple shape and cleaner design were too appealing. And so, this has been packed (stuffed) the same way for a whole bunch of short trips. The top pocket (made of concerningly-thin fabric) is for the same small essentials as before. The front pocket is for the same larger essentials. The hidden front pocket, which has no room to expand, is for small papers, like boarding passes. And then the main compartment for clothes and a laptop in the laptop sleeve.</p>
<p>I still enjoy this backpack, though like I said above, I&rsquo;m always looking for the next one. Maybe that will have a similar appearance, but actually functioning side pockets, and better ventilation down the back. I can&rsquo;t be seen with the giant patch of back sweat anymore!</p>
<h2>Old Navy Pencil Case</h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/pencilcase.jpg" alt="Pencil Case for Toiletries" class="right">
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s say 1998 &ndash; July 2018: </strong>My brothers and I were each gifted one of these in our respective colors sometime in the late 1990s. They were never used as pencil cases, rather as teeny tiny dopp kits. I can remember packing my toothbrush and a travel toothpaste in mine and taking it to a sleepover all the way back in 8th grade. And I continued to do so twenty years later (and even then with some additional things like floss, chapstick, and earplugs).</p>
<p>The thing is, while the pencil case has been more than adequate in size to carry overnight toiletries, and appreciably small enough to toss in a backpack pocket, it was never intended for this. For one, it&rsquo;s not waterproof, and a wet toothbrush soaks through the fabric every time. For another, like many things from Old Navy, I doubt it was designed to last this long. Look at the radiant blue of the interior compared to the faded blue of the outside. Plus, it looks downright juvenile to plop this down in the bathroom of a shared Airbnb.</p>
<p>So this summer, I upgraded to a (still undersized) <a href="https://www.alchemygoods.com/products/elliott-mini-toiletries-kit?variant=16570699841">dopp kit made out of recycled tires</a>. It is nothing if not waterproof, though significantly larger and less pliable. I&rsquo;ll have to pack it in the main compartment of my backpack now. And it still smells like rubber, which I&rsquo;m a little worried will transfer to the clothes in the same compartment.</p>
<h2>Pro Spirit Athletic Shorts</h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/shorts.jpg" alt="Pro Spirit Athletic Shorts" class="right">
<p><strong>Fall 2004 &ndash; Summer 2020: </strong>I bought these reversible drawstring gym shorts at Target in the first semester of my sophomore year. My roommate bought the same pair. He usually wore his with the light blue side out, so I wore mine navy out, and continue that way today. It&rsquo;s entirely possible that this was the pair that started my obsession with wearing gym shorts all day everyday. I was told later that school year that I was known across campus as the polo shirt and gym shorts guy at parties.</p>
<p>And these don&rsquo;t even have pockets! I remember many a skateboard trip in college in these shorts and an aforementioned polo shirt; my college ID, debit card, and iPod shuffle in the chest pocket like a hapless dweeb. These shorts are so lightweight and breathable that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m wearing anything.</p>
<p>My current go-to shorts are also from Target, and (purely coincidentally) in the same two shades of blue. These C9 brand shorts aren&rsquo;t reversible &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking about two pairs here &ndash; but they have pockets and the same barely-there weight. It&rsquo;s an outright shame that Target does not make nor sell any shorts like these anymore.</p>
<h2>Coach Leather Belt</h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/belt.jpg" alt="Leather Belt" class="right">
<p><strong>Spring 2003 &ndash; Present: </strong>Another gift before I started college. I have never found a black leather belt with the same qualities that I love in this one: the matte finish of the leather, its low weight, the simplicity of the buckle, and the way it develops a patina over years of use. Perhaps most impressive of all is that I&rsquo;ve been able to use the same notch the whole time: the middle one out of the five. The only pair of dress shoes I own now is brown, purposefully to match this belt. I don&rsquo;t think it will ever wear out.</p>
<h2>Vornado Small Air Circulator</h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/vornado.jpg" alt="Vornado Fan" class="right">
<p><strong>August 2006 &ndash; Present: </strong>Purchased for my college senior year dorm room, to augment the building&rsquo;s central air conditioning. It ran silently in the corner and kept me cool in the Southern California heat. I packed it up and took it with me after graduation, and it sporadically came out for a respite from summer heat.</p>
<p>Now I live in South Florida, where you pretty much require air conditioning from April to October. This fan is now a full-time resident in the corner of my bedroom. It augments the A/C overnight, keeping me from setting the temperature even lower and driving up my electric bill. And in those blessed months when I can get by with open windows and a cross breeze, it makes sure that stays the case. It hasn&rsquo;t degraded at all with time and use; it&rsquo;s still as quiet and powerful as ever.</p>

<title>Gump and Country</title>

<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The Gump &amp; Co oyster bidness was goin so well, a big man in New York City ast me to come up an talk. He said that there was a Bubba Gump restaurant in New York that served thousands of people every day, an if they liked srimp, they would like oysters too. So I went. They say New York City is &ldquo;the big apple&rdquo;, but every apple I saw there was regular size.</p>
<p>Now I ain&rsquo;t really the type of man who likes seein his name everwhere. Bubba Gump restaurants, Bubba Gump shirts, Bubba Gump hats, Gump &amp; Co this, Gump &amp; Co that. But this man put his name on his apartment buildin, an he lived on the top floor. I rode up a golden elevator to his floor like Willy Wonka or somethin, an there he was. &ldquo;Forrest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You have a nack for the seafood industry.&rdquo; I tole him that every time I find myself broke or ruint, I go back home to Alabama because things are easier there. &ldquo;That is tremendous,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He tole me he would pay me five million dollars if I would let him build a Gump &amp; Co restaurant in New York City. Five million dollars! &ldquo;Well sir, that is a fine offer, but I don&rsquo;t need all that money,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We could split it between my son, Little Forrest, an all my friends who work at the company too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal!&rdquo; he shouted. He would say that word alot.</p>
<p>The big man said we should celebrate at his casino, so we went that night, to New Jersey. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know, his name was on this buildin too. It wadn&rsquo;t like any Biloxi casino I&rsquo;d ever seen. He called it the Taj Mahal, after a buildin in India that looked the same. But alot of the fellers I saw gamblin inside were Russians, not Injuns. Anyways, the big man kept buyin me Diet Cokes, puttin them on his tab or somethin. We were havin a good time an all, but there was somethin about the hole situation that didn&rsquo;t feel right. So I asked where the bathroom was, cause I had to pee. An one of his Russian friends shouted some gobbledygook at me, so I figured I&rsquo;d find it myself.</p>
<p>I thought I had found the bathroom, so I opened the door an walked in to a little room an then another room. Sometimes bathrooms in fancy buildins like casinos have a little room first. The bigger room didn&rsquo;t have a toilet, an all the lights was out, but by this point I was fit to burst so I began to pee anyways. Well, it was another one of these Russian feller&rsquo;s hotel rooms, an I was peein on his bed! He came runnin in to the room from somewhere else, cussin an hollerin in Russian, until I zipped my thing up. &ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo; he ast me in English, finally. I tole him the big man who&rsquo;s name was on the buildin, an he calmed down an said &ldquo;Ok. Ve vill remember this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to cause any more trouble so I waved good-bye an foun my way back to the craps table where the big man an all his friends were. All of a sudden they all started talkin to little microphones in their ears like Dick Tracy, an then shoutin at him an each other, until he said &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a deal.&rdquo; Turns out, he declared bankrupcy on that casino so he could give them some money to make it all better. &ldquo;Forrest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some how it came up in conversation that I use to play a little football, an this cheered him up. So we went to watch a New England Patriots football game at their stadium in Boston. The big man said he knew the guy who owned the team, an the quarterback, an that they all were friends. I was surprised his name wadn&rsquo;t on the football stadium too. His friend the owner wadn&rsquo;t there, which must of been why they stuck us way up in the nose bleed seats with a bunch of people from Boston aroun us.</p>
<p>They started playin the national anthem an I looked down to see that the big man&rsquo;s shoe was untied. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Your shoe is untied an the lace fell in a puddle, dunno if it is beer or pee.&rdquo; I thought it would make him laugh, but he knelt down to tie his shoe an all of a sudden the Boston fans were yellin an thowin they drinks at him, callin him &ldquo;queer&rdquo; an &ldquo;snow flake&rdquo; an things like that. I think they really hurt his feelins. He grabbed my red Bubba Gump hat out of my hand an slapped it on my head. &ldquo;Look at him,&rdquo; he shouted back at them. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t take his hat off for the national anthem!&rdquo; Then the Boston fans started thowin they things at me too. &ldquo;Forrest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry what happened back there, Forrest.&rdquo; he tole me as we was walkin out of the stadium. &ldquo;I will never forget how that crowd hated me kneelin for the anthem or how your red hat saved me.&rdquo; I tole him everythin was fine, but I should really be gettin back home to Alabama. We shook hands an he said he would call me if there was another opportunity for a bidness deal. There was that word again.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you know, some years later, that big man became the President. His hole campaign was about red hats an pissin on a Russian&rsquo;s bed. An I didn&rsquo;t hear from him once, not even the five million dollars he promised me that day in New York City. But then one day, out of the blue, he called me.  &ldquo;Forrest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Would you like to come to North Korea with me to meet a rocket man?&rdquo; Now, ordinarily I don&rsquo;t say yes to these things. But when the President of the United States asks you to meet a astronaut, doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say, you might as well of said yes.</p>
<p><em>With apologies to Winston Groom.</em></p>

<title>Pastecard S</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/pastecard-s.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>A major update to the main Pastecard web app went out this week, which I&rsquo;m calling Pastecard S. Much like the iPhone hardware updates of the same designation, the experience should more or less look and feel the same, with everything souped up under the hood. I also call it Pastecard S because all the new features (can be forced to) start with S.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>All of Pastecard&rsquo;s web traffic is over SSL now: start your URLs with <span class="code">https</span> instead of <span class="code">http</span>! A mere four months ago, I figured this would be impossible to do on an operating budget of zero dollars. Not so! My utmost and sincere thanks to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> for providing SSL certificates absolutely free of charge. And bonus thanks to my web host for having a one-click deploy for the Let&rsquo;s Encrypt certificate. It was literally one click, that cost me nothing, to get this done. I&rsquo;m a dummy.</p>
<h2>Service Workers</h2>
<p>In another moment of dumb laziness four months ago, I decided making the switch from App Cache to Service Workers would be impossible, as they require <span class="code">https</span> traffic. Once that first piece was in place, creating a simple service worker that did everything the old app cache did was easy &ndash; there are plenty of tutorials and even generators online for this. However, that first service worker only, um, <em>worked</em> for the single-user version of the app I put on Github, where the root is an <span class="code">index.html</span> file.</p>
<p>The Pastecard web app has an <span class="code">index.php</span> root, which takes the username from the URL as a parameter. It took me longer than I&rsquo;d like to admit to figure out how to pass that parameter to the service worker itself, and then instruct it to cache that vanity URL as the root. All of this is to say, Pastecard should still work offline, whether you use it at pastecard.net or your own updated install from Github, as it did before. Only now it&rsquo;s using a modern caching technology instead of one that was deprecated from the start.</p>
<h2>Signups</h2>
<p>Consider this my GDPR update, coming in right under the wire! Inspired by <a href="https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42">Overcast&rsquo;s related update</a>, I no longer collect email addresses at signup. I initially thought they would be useful to have, in case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone emailed a support question, and I could identify their account</li>
<li>Someone created a bunch of accounts, foolishly using the same email address each time</li>
<li>I wanted to email the whole user base about something</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess what? None of those situations ever happened. So I no longer write any data to disk other than your username, your card text, and time stamps when anything happens. I am not a lawyer, but I think I&rsquo;m good? (Please don&rsquo;t come after me.)</p>
<h2>So long, div</h2>
<p>From day one, the underlying HTML structure of Pastecard was a <span class="code">div</span> representing the card out of edit mode, and a visually-identical <span class="code">textarea</span> representing the card in edit mode. This led to a lot of extra code to translate between HTML in the div and plain text in the textarea, among other minor annoyances. As I upgraded the offline caching to a modern method with service workers, I figured I could simplify the whole app by getting rid of the div entirely, and instead apply the similarly modern (to me, at least) <span class="code">readonly</span> attribute to the textarea when it&rsquo;s not in edit mode. So, that&rsquo;s what I did. It might have resulted in the biggest code deletion in Pastecard&rsquo;s (public) history.</p>
<p>There it is, Pastecard S. Leaner, safer, and future-proof. All while looking and feeling the same. Okay, I made the trademark blue border a little bigger.</p>

<title>End Screen Bloat</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/end-screen-bloat.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Last summer, <a href="http://www.everyinteraction.com/blog/bad-app-citizens/">discussion</a> peaked about the aggregate size of app updates for essentially nothing other than vague &ldquo;bug fixes and performance improvements&rdquo;. Consider Facebook, which updates its flagship app, Messenger, and Instagram all more than once a month, to hundreds of millions of users, at 100+MB each time. Aside from the impact to each user, the combined resources and power to store and deliver these bundles can&rsquo;t be negligible.</p>
<p>I wonder if the same can be said for YouTube end screens. You&rsquo;re probably familiar with these: the extra couple seconds of footage after a YouTube video with buttons to subscribe to the channel, or jump directly to another highlighted or recent video, on top of channel imaging or b-roll. I don&rsquo;t know they work behind the scenes beyond <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6388789?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">this help page</a>, but it does look like they&rsquo;re rendered and tacked onto the actual movie file. And, speaking only for myself here, I think they&rsquo;re worthless. I rarely if ever interact with them and almost always close the tab when they begin playing.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDUud96oGK5xQ9gyg913vw">Desus &amp; Mero</a><sup><a href="#fn-1-esb" id="fr-1-esb">1</a></sup> channel as an example. They air four nights a week and usually share four clips from the show the next day, each ending with a title card and end screen. As of this writing, the channel has over 93 million total views. Let&rsquo;s assume half of those views played the entire video, including the title card and end screen, at an average quality of 720p. I grabbed a recent clip in 720p using <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> and trimmed out the content, leaving 13 seconds of end screen footage at ~1.25MB. Multiplied by the 1,130 videos they&rsquo;ve uploaded, that&rsquo;s over 1.4 gigabytes of the same<sup><a href="#fn-2-esb" id="fr-2-esb">2</a></sup> end screen footage stored with Google. Storage space is cheap, but not free. And, multiplied by 46.5 million views, that&rsquo;s over 58 <em>terabytes</em> of bandwidth, for the same footage played over and over.</p>
<p>Of course, there were a lot of assumptions just made and the figure could be much, much lower. But it&rsquo;s still staggering to think of all the popular YouTube channels with full-quality end screens, both taking up space on Google&rsquo;s servers &ndash; propagated across their vast CDN &ndash; and streamed to viewers. Something to think about this Earth Day.</p>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li id="fn-1-esb">Number one show on late night, with the most illustrious guests. <a href="#fr-1-esb">↩︎︎</a></li>
<li id="fn-2-esb">Well, they updated it around the start of the second season. <a href="#fr-2-esb">↩︎︎</a></li>

<title>River Mountains &amp; Historic Railroad Trails</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/river-mountains-historic-railroad.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=36.060832&lon=-114.868828&zoom=12.34">25.3 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rmhr1.jpg" alt="River Mountains Loop Trail" class="poster">
<p>Henderson, NV is maybe twenty minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. You exit the freeway and start to move through the residential neighborhoods, and all the homes are beige. The yards are beige. Today started about three hours late thanks to a mishandled checked bag, and as the car drove through Henderson to the trailhead, my mood was more or less beige.</p>
<p>I chose Equestrian Park as my starting point, about three miles into the <a href="https://rivermountainstrail.org/trailheads-and-maps/">River Mountains Loop Trail</a> by its mile markers. The name of that park evokes maybe some horses, or wide open green space. But it was more beige: sand, cacti, and scrub brush. Nevertheless, the smooth asphalt trail with lane markings looked good to me, and I started off with spirits high. For the first couple miles, the towering casinos of the strip glistened in the distance to my left. Their dazzle was in such contrast to the simple, arid landscape that they felt even farther away.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rmhr2.jpg" alt="Las Vegas Strip in the distance" class="center">
<p>Once the trail turned away from the strip and started making its way toward Lake Mead, the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; part of its name started to make sense. I spent a few stretches walking, both uphill and some downhills, because as the topography became more severe, the trail itself started adopting traditional road features like switchbacks. Flying down hairpin turns was not something I was interested in, in the same way I would not enjoy scraping my knees and having the blood just kinda evaporate into the hot dry air. One of these particularly perilous stretches is called out on the map as Three Sisters. Three hills in quick succession? Felt like more.</p>
<p>At mile marker 14, the trail merged onto an abandoned stretch of Lakeshore Road. Old-style rounded concrete curbs dotted its southern border, and it often cut through hillsides. I could visualize Frank Sinatra driving a Cadillac with the top down on his way to the tables.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rmhr3.jpg" alt="trail cut through the hills" class="center">
<p>From here, both the elevation changes and the views only got more dramatic. Coming down from the carved mountain road, Lake Mead started to sneak into view. Time and climate being what it is, I could see the telltale lines across its edges where water levels were higher in the past, as much as I could see the remaining water. Then the trail curved away again to head toward an imposing, probably impassible mountain range. I took a breather and started to wonder what I&rsquo;d gotten myself into – surely that challenging section where a road was cut through a (smaller, okay) mountain range was as hard as it would get! A cyclist headed in the opposite direction stopped to get my attention. He pointed to a tiny figure in the distance, two or three switchbacks away. &ldquo;Check on her for me, okay? I&rsquo;m worried about her.&rdquo; A few minutes later, I caught up to her fumbling with her pack. &ldquo;Oh, did he ask about me? I was only taking off a layer!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rmhr4.jpg" alt="Hualapai Lodge" class="left">Sneaking more around the foothills of these mountains than going directly through them, the trail started to run parallel to Lake Mead&rsquo;s shores. There were gigantic equipment installations, no doubt to steal what little water remained for the thirsty strip. There was a huge marina in the distance, and closer a little beach area with a vast parking lot full of RVs. And then, a little ways back toward the mountains from that, the abandoned Lake Mead Lodge. Roped off with heavy chains and traffic cones, it was clear they didn&rsquo;t want me poking around. So I hopped back on the trail and started climbing for what seemed like forever but wasn&rsquo;t very far, as proven by the trailside plaque detailing the Lodge&rsquo;s downfall as receding water levels took away its lakefront status.</p>
<p>More arduous uphills in a falling yet still bright sun brought me to a fork in the trail. The River Mountains Loop continued to the right, approximately 13 miles back to where I started. The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/hikerr.htm">Historic Railroad Trail</a> diverged to the left, a gravel path over the old railway used to bring equipment to the then-under-construction Hoover Dam. I&rsquo;d planned on taking this detour, 3.3 miles out to see the dam, doubling back, and finishing the loop, so off to the left I went. While the gravel forcing me to walk was a bummer, walking was actually nice. Even though I&rsquo;d been complaining about going uphill for hours, I couldn&rsquo;t appreciate just how far uphill it had been until the path turned a corner and there was that same marina, looking like a model train miniature, infinitely far below me. Such elevation achieved entirely through human power!</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rmhr5.jpg" alt="Lake Mead Marina" class="center">
<p class="caption">started from the bottom, now I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>The railroad path continued through a series of tunnels, seemingly unchanged from when they were blasted in the 1930s. Giant wooden timbers propped up the archway entrances, and some of the longer ones felt like background scenery from Indiana Jones. The path went straight up to the parking lot for the Hoover Dam visitor center, where I obviously took a break to walk around and be a tourist.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/rmhr6.jpg" alt="Historic Railroad Trail tunnel" class="center">
<p>The break became permanent because the sun was already showing signs of setting and I was facing an hour&rsquo;s walk back just to rejoin the loop trail. On the drive back, I got to see a fair chunk of the remaining trail running parallel to the road. It was smooth concrete with matching sloped walls rising up from either side. It basically looked like the LA River in any movie: the race in <em>Grease</em>, the opening of <em>The Core</em>, any movie! There were even arched gates over the trail every once in a while, looking like artificial height restrictions, complete with stop signs. So I don&rsquo;t entirely feel like I missed out or failed to achieve my goal of doing the whole thing. Two thirds of all those uphills was plenty.</p>

<title>Pastecard for iOS</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/pastecard-for-ios.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Pastecard now has a native iPhone app. This is a big departure from the product philosophy of prioritizing a web app experience that works&mdash;without a login or password&mdash;on anything with a modern browser. Before I get to why I made it, I should mention it is not available in the App Store. You have to download the source from <a href="https://github.com/bsuto/Pastecard-iOS">Github</a>, create a project in Xcode, and install it on your phone over a USB cable. This is mainly because Apple charges $99/year<sup><a href="#fn-1-pios" id="fr-1-pios">1</a></sup> to put apps in the App Store, whether they make money or not. And Pastecard most certainly does not. Furthermore, it would make this small side project feel much more serious and potentially open up my lazy programming to more competent malfeasants.</p>
<p>So why make it at all? Well, it&rsquo;s arguably the best way for me to learn a new programming language, because I know every piece of what the app is supposed to do and how it&rsquo;s supposed to look and feel as it does it. And now, Swift is now the third language Pastecard has been written in, after <a href="https://github.com/bsuto/Pastecard/blob/master/pastecard.js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pastecard/status/549692516380180480">HyperTalk</a>. Did I end up really learning Swift? Absolutely not. My process had three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Watch some free online videos of how to lay apps out in Interface Builder and connect interface elements to code. Constraints, outlets, and actions, baby!</li>
<li>Rewrite the JavaScript for each function in remedial Swift. Let Xcode automatically correct the errors it can, Google the answers to the rest (which are almost always on Stack Exchange).</li>
<li>Run the app in the simulator, try all test cases I can think of, go back and repeat step two until it feels right.</li>
</ol>
<p>My programming knowledge and experience have marginally increased from their low initial levels as a result. I don&rsquo;t really know JavaScript, either.</p>
<p>Another reason to make a native app came up as I went. The Pastecard web app uses two separate technologies to function offline: local storage and app cache. The former is how the user&rsquo;s card text is stored on the device, and the latter is how the web app itself is &ldquo;installed&rdquo; on the device. And pretty much the entire time Pastecard has supported going offline, app cache has been a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache">deprecated</a> technology and strongly advised against. Whoops!</p>
<p>The replacement for app cache, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers">service workers</a>, I purposefully ignored because they weren&rsquo;t supported in Safari. I am at least half of the Pastecard user base, and I exclusively use Safari! This conveniently let me ignore also that service workers require <span class="code">https</span>, a rabbit hole of time and expense.<sup><a href="#fn-2-pios" id="fr-2-pios">2</a></sup> And then, as I worked on the iOS app, the Safari beta <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8042/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-46/">added support</a> for service workers, all but signaling that its next major version in 2018 will support them (and maybe stop supporting app cache at the same time). So by the end of the year, I foresee a fork in the road of either rewriting the web app to support service workers, or removing the ability for the web app to function offline altogether&mdash;on iOS <em>and</em> Android&mdash;and asking people to use this new app instead on their iPhones. (Android people would have to make sure their phones were always online. Sorry.)</p>
<p>In summary, I fumbled and bumbled my way through recreating Pastecard as a native iOS app. It began as a learning exercise and may end up the default way to use Pastecard on iPhones, despite my best wishes. Software development is a mystery.</p>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li id="fn-1-pios"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/">Not anymore</a> for certain nonprofits or students, neither of which Pastecard really qualifies as. <a href="#fr-1-pios">↩︎︎</a></li>
<li id="fn-2-pios">Long story short: Pastecard uses a very bare bones shared web host for free, and moving to a different host that supports SSL will likely add a yearly hosting cost as well as a yearly certificate cost. To say nothing of rewriting the backend from a folder of text files to a legitimate database. <a href="#fr-2-pios">↩︎︎</a></li>

<title>American River Parkway</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/american-river-parkway.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=38.622505&lon=-121.325582&zoom=11.72">31.8 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp1.jpg" alt="American River Parkway" class="poster">
<p>The name of the game today was beat the heat. When our plane touched down in Sacramento yesterday and we had to deplane and walk across the tarmac like animals, it was 101˚. Today&rsquo;s forecast set the high at 107˚, to peak around 4:00. So I set my alarm early and was on the trail at 6:45, fifteen minutes after sunrise. It was already 80˚, by the way.</p>
<p>The American River Parkway officially begins a mile or two before where I joined it, in Old Town Sacramento. From there, it follows the American River east to the Folsom Reservoir. It&rsquo;s also named the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail, after an early white explorer who marveled at the beauty of the river as he colonized it away from its native inhabitants. You can read more about old Jedediah and see a detailed map in the <a href="http://arpf.org/pdf_files/ARPmap.pdf">trail brochure</a> (4MB PDF). You may also notice &ldquo;Skateboards are not permitted&rdquo; in the Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p>This trail is the most like a tiny highway for bicycles that I&rsquo;ve been on so far. It&rsquo;s smooth, well-maintained asphalt with lane markings, signed exits with their own little off-ramps to intersecting city roads, and it passes under an interstate or two. Early in the morning, as the sun was still rising, I saw many turkey-ish birds and two majestic coyotes. And, yes, markings on the pavement every mile or so reminding me that skateboards were indeed prohibited.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp2.jpg" alt="Skateboards Prohibited" class="center">
<p>However, for the majority of the day, no one seemed to care. I passed cyclists, joggers, and even rangers who didn&rsquo;t acknowledge me whatsoever. The first third of the trail went by early enough in the day that there weren&rsquo;t too many people out. The middle third was packed &mdash; this is clearly a popular exercise trail &mdash; and one guy finally called me out. He snapped &ldquo;no skateboards allowed, <em>buddy</em>&rdquo; at me as he passed on his bike, white ponytail whipping in the breeze out of a hole in his helmet. I shouted &ldquo;thank you!&rdquo; after him and carried a small grudge for a minute or two. Not too much farther along, an older gentleman was walking his dog in the opposite direction. The dog barked and lunged at me so violently that it pulled its owner down to the ground and I stopped to make sure he was okay. That made me feel guilty for giving him skinned knees as a direct result of breaking the rules, so I skated on a parallel road for a little bit afterward.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp3.jpg" alt="Nimbus Dam" class="center">
<p>Not for long though! I rejoined the trail in time to cross over the river at the Nimbus Dam. Really steep grades getting up, over, and back down the bridge, so at least I was walking and not offending anyone. Back on the northern side of the river, I think the official American River Parkway section of the bike trail ends. There were conspicuously fewer &ldquo;skateboards prohibited&rdquo; signs, if any. Either way, I got back on the board, on the trail itself, and kept going.</p>
<p>This final third was more like the first: surrounded by more nature than people. I even got off the trail around mile 25 to clamber through some brush and up a small but decent hill. It was 10:15 in the morning and up to 90˚, and the panoramic view from the top was worth it.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp4.jpg" alt="American River panorama" class="poster">
<p>I took a few glugs of water, shimmied down the hill, and rejoined the trail. It felt like life couldn&rsquo;t get any better, and then the path forward was abruptly cut off.
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp5.jpg" alt="Trail closed" class="right">Maybe it was the heat. I thought &ldquo;well, I guess I have to turn around, double back a couple miles, go back over the dam, and take city streets close to the river until I can cross again.&rdquo; And I actually turned around and started to go back. I stopped under a tree for some shade to open the Maps app and figure out how much all this would set me back. Then someone whizzed by on her bike, from the direction of the roadblock. It took me longer than I&rsquo;d like to admit to realize, duh, I could easily go around it and at least see what was up. I had been breaking rules all day, no reason to stop now!</p>
<p>The closed section of the trail was maybe a mile long. At first, there was evidence of some small landslides that had cast a boulder or two onto the trail, and then I reached the big one. Entire swaths of the hillside had crumbled to the ground and completely buried the trail in giant rocks. I passed two guys portaging their bikes over the impossible terrain&mdash;advantage, skateboard. And it was a nice geology 101 refresher, looking for cleavage lines and identifying sedimentary rock layers. A quick sidestep of the roadblock on the other end, and it was smooth sailing for the rest of the way. Well, smooth pavement. The final five miles were arduous uphills as the trail moved with the river up toward its outlet at Folsom Dam.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp6.jpg" alt="Folsom Prison" class="center">
<p>Folsom Dam, Folsom Reservoir, and yes, Folsom Prison. As the trail curved left to start meandering up another hill, a clear view of the facility lay to the right. It was pretty cool and pretty chilling at the same time, though the latter may have been more due to the <a href="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/arp7.jpg">rocks arranged into a cross</a> here. A grave for a potential escapee? I kept sneaking glances at the prison as long as I could for the rest of the ride into Beals Point. The temperature read 99˚ at the finish line, and I was almost tempted to jump right into the water. Instead, I waited in the shade for a Lyft to pick me up. The driver mentioned that he likes to run this final section of the trail, and very casually segued into the fact that he&rsquo;s an ultra-marathoner. Which made it all the sweeter when he said, with genuine enthusiasm, that he found it impressive that I&rsquo;d done the whole trail on a skateboard. &ldquo;Mr. Ultra-skateboarder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reaction aside, the majority of this trail is still &ldquo;no skateboards allowed&rdquo; and there was that one ponytail offended that I broke the rule. So I can&rsquo;t recommend it for other skateboarders, especially if the temperature is flirting with triple digits. It was gorgeous and beautifully maintained, but all the same I&rsquo;m happy to be back in air conditioning.</p>

<title>Banks-Vernonia State Trail</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/banks-vernonia-trail.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=45.778894&lon=-123.180927&zoom=11.23">23.6 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/bv1.jpg" alt="Banks-Vernonia Trail" class="poster">
<p>Sometime last night, the house dog of this Airbnb lost all control of its bowels &mdash; on both floors. I woke up early to screaming and opened my door a crack. I could see across the hall, into the bathroom, an artful splatter up and down the shower walls. So while everyone else flailed in disgusted panic, I hastily got dressed, threw my toothbrush and some granola bars into my pack, and bolted.</p>
<p>The trail is a good ways west of Portland, and the long Lyft drive gave me many opportunities to wonder at the countryside and spark conversation with the driver. For the former, gently rolling farmland bordered by mountains at the horizons; for the latter, agreement that the new Taylor Swift song is &ldquo;pretty pretty bad.&rdquo; She dropped me off at the southern trailhead in Banks and headed back to the city. I took advantage of the facilities to brush my teeth and fill my water pack before setting off.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/bv2.jpg" alt="Banks-Vernonia Trail" class="center">
<p>This is Oregon&rsquo;s first rails-to-trail, uh, trail, handed over to the state parks department in 1990. For the first mile or so north out of Banks, a sibling railroad track runs parallel. Other than that, there&rsquo;s relatively little to observe, especially compared to the Willamette River Loop that&rsquo;s always passing through towns and cities. Here, instead, it&rsquo;s either a paved trail through forest, branches drooping over you and making the occasional crude arch, or paved trail through open farmland. It&rsquo;s very quiet too. I almost felt guilty at how much noise my rattling skateboard was creating.</p>
<p>The majority of the first half was at a very slight uphill, enough to make me question whether I was still tired from two days ago. The asphalt was smooth in places and coarse in others, though needles dropped from the trees had been kind of worn into the cracks by constant cycling, smoothing out the coarse bits. It never felt overwhelming, and nevertheless I stopped at the optimistically-named Tophill trailhead for a breather. I also took the chance to tighten the hardware on my board in the hopes it would reduce the rattling. It didn&rsquo;t, but I sure felt like a real handyman for a minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/bv3.jpg" alt="Railroad Crossing sign" class="left">Most of the other people I saw were on their bicycles, either zooming past me in the other direction or passing me from behind. One of the few joggers I passed was out with her dog, who became very scared upon my approach. &ldquo;A skateboard is the only thing he hasn&rsquo;t seen on this trail!&rdquo; Score another bewilderment point for me.</p>
<p>After the initial few miles of parallel active railroad track, there wasn&rsquo;t much indication that the trail itself used to be a railway. The few reminders that survived were particularly noteable. One was a nice, long <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYOVWRqn5HW/">trestle bridge</a> elevated way above the valley. Its floor surface was new pavement, obviously, but the sides looked like the original wood. And then a random railroad crossing sign, far away from any road. Maybe put in after the fact, as a joke.</p>
<p>At around the halfway point of the trail, a series of severe switchbacks brought me down to a road crossing and back up from it. I had to walk both of these, again for fear of faceplanting and getting tired, respectively. And then it was smooth sailing the rest of the way, likely from a similarly subtle downhill. Judging from distance markers, I was able to coast over one and a half miles without having to kick for more speed or drag a foot to slow down. It was the dessert after dinner, paycheck after work, reaping what I&rsquo;d sowed.</p>
<p>The trail ends after some 21 miles in Vernonia, with a quick little loop around Vernonia Lake. As would be later confirmed by a local, Vernonia Lake is more of a pond, or even a puddle. It&rsquo;s the spot where the Oregon-American Lumber Company set up shop, as little placards around the perimeter will tell you. But for the ultimate end to my day, I hopped off the loop and explored the abandoned saw mill. A huge structure reduced to its four walls: completely gutted on the inside with only a tiny section of roof remaining. Full-grown trees have taken root inside and are now sprouting out the top. And Oregon&rsquo;s finest street artists have decorated all throughout the interior. It feels like a house of worship, for some religion crossed between nature devotees and rebellious taggers. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYOrzyvnZWh/">Stepping inside</a>, no joke, took my breath away.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/bv4.jpg" alt="Old Mill Interior panorama" class="poster">
<p>My phone died shortly after taking a bunch of photos and video, and I was suddenly left on my own to find my way back to civilization. It&rsquo;s not like Lyft operated that far outside Portland anyway. Mostly out of curiosity, I called the closest Yellow Cab dispatch to see if they would pick me up in Vernonia, and they replied a curt &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So my only option (short of hitchhiking) was Vernonia&rsquo;s public transportation: a minivan that departs from city hall for Beaverton twice every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I&rsquo;d missed the first departure at 6:30am, and would have to kill a couple hours until the second at 4:30pm the old-fashioned way &mdash; sans phone. First, I walked to the little public library and sampled their selection of magazines from a year ago. Next, I walked up and down the three-block town, observing what were mostly bars and antique/novelty shops. At the east end, there&rsquo;s a small city park along the river, with a small shallow pool carved out of the bank. A lone teenaged lifeguard sat watch over the empty pool and I felt very sorry for her.</p>
<p>When the time came to leave, I was (surprise!) the only passenger in the minivan. We talked about the history of Vernonia and the pros and cons of these public access trails on our slow drive east. Two eager passengers took my place in the minivan for its final Friday trip home, and I boarded the blue metro line for most of the way back, covering the final miles again by skateboard. What cost just under $50 via Lyft was only $8.50 via public transportation, which seems appropriate for this whole skateboarding on bike trails thing.</p>

<title>Willamette River Loop</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/willamette-river-loop.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=45.433983&lon=-122.624893&zoom=11.62">29.2 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/wrl1.jpg" alt="Willamette River Loop" class="poster">
<p>I got into Portland last night at a time appropriate for a late dinner. The Lyft driver dropped me off at the Airbnb &mdash; how millennial! &mdash; after sharing some secrets of the city: &ldquo;the bicyclists are assholes, but the women are nice to look at.&rdquo; I dropped my stuff in the room, and went out looking for food. Late dinner was a vegan barbecue-and-slaw sandwich: not entirely my choice, more of a lesser of two evils situation. Weed smoke was easily discernible in the air. And that was my introduction to Portland.</p>
<p>The city is bisected into a west half and an east half by the Willamette River, which I still do not, and never will, pronounce correctly. Many bridges offer cars and people alike the chance to cross it near downtown and other cities close by. More relevant to me, there are bike paths around the river that loosely combine into a <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/430863">namesake trail</a> (10MB PDF), almost 30 miles in total. I woke up and skateboarded a mile and change west to start at the recommended trailhead near the northeast corner, and followed it clockwise.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/wrl2.jpg" alt="Downtown Portland" class="center">
<p>Immediately, the loop runs right next to the river on its eastern bank. It&rsquo;s a brief tour of the industrious side of Portland: factories, warehouses, and garages. The city skyline beckons from across the river. Also immediately, you pass through a tent city that&rsquo;s both impressive in scope and depressing for it. This stretch is very nice otherwise, catching cold gusts off the water and temporary echoes as you cruise under the labyrinth of overpasses. The bridge closest to the science museum, naturally, has one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_mirror">acoustic mirrors</a> within its support structures on either side of the river. No one was across from me when I passed, sadly.</p>
<p>Two designated bike paths make up the next large segment, the Springwater Corridor and the Trolley Trail. These are nestled between a single train track and some foliage buffers, rather than running right along the river. I saw many many bikes and a few joggers, almost all going in the opposite direction as me. It was the perfect opportunity to put in some headphones and listen to sports heads talk about yesterday&rsquo;s Kyrie Irving trade, without worry of collisions or intersections. What few intersections there were had their own miniaturized STOP signs for the bike path. I ignored them all!</p>
<p>I crossed the river for the first time near Oregon City, <a href="https://www.historicoregoncity.org/">the final stop on The Oregon Trail</a>. The loop was supposed to pick up on Main Street, which was under construction to make room for what looked like gentrification condos. I made two complete confused circles around a shopping center before picking up the trail, crossing the river a second time and spying waterfalls in the distance.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/wrl3.jpg" alt="Willamette Falls" class="center">
<p>This was roughly halfway, and in retrospect, the far easier and more picturesque half was behind me. That second bridge merged onto state highway 43, one to two lanes of traffic in each direction with a dedicated bike lane in lieu of a shoulder. It brought to mind state highway 17 in South Carolina, with traffic zooming close by at highway speeds and the occasional semi truck. Where I could, I got onto a sidewalk. And more often than not, I found myself walking. Because this second half of the loop &mdash; the western half &mdash; is almost always on an incline. And these aren&rsquo;t gradual inclines: the uphills zap any skating momentum and energy, and the downhills generate more speed than I was comfortable with, that close to traffic.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/wrl4.jpg" alt="Oswego Iron Furnace" class="left">That&rsquo;s not to say there weren&rsquo;t highlights. There&rsquo;s a dedicated paved trail set aside from the road on the outskirts of Mary S Young Park. The asphalt was smooth as glass, and it appeared to be level ground, safe to skate freely. However, when I crossed the threshold of the park and hit this path, it was as if my board hit one of those <a href="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/wii/images/2/2c/MKDD_LuigiCircuit-1-.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100530163921">Mario Kart boost pads</a>. Obviously, it must have been at a slight decline, but I didn&rsquo;t have to kick and kept gaining speed as if I was on a steep downhill. And then before hitting downtown Lake Oswego, the George Rogers Park trail brought me to an old iron furnace &mdash; the first of its kind on the west coast! The loop did take me straight through the city of Lake Oswego, which felt like a ski village: crisp clean air, charming shops for upscale brands, and an abundance of affluent-looking white folks.</p>
<p>And then for what seemed like forever after that, the loop continued ascending and descending a frustratingly diverse Oregon topography. I had walked through the bustling downtown because it was crowded with people, and I kept walking on the following bike lanes and sidewalks to avoid tiring out or bailing at high speed. To be fair, this stretch was through a gorgeous forest of Pacific Northwest trees. It almost felt like I was in a lonely reboot of <em>Twilight</em>. When I reached a stopping point that I was certain to be near the end (it wasn&rsquo;t), I was rewarded with a great view of the distant Mount Hood.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/wrl5.jpg" alt="Mount Hood" class="center">
<p>A couple more miles downhill and out of the forest, one or two passes over or under major interstates, and I was back in Portland. The western half this time, clearly the downtown and even through Portland State University&rsquo;s campus at first. More walking to avoid colliding with pedestrians, and I ended at the other side of the river from where I started. The western bank is designated a city park with the requisite green space, and the nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_Ends_Park">Mill Ends Park</a> standing watch.</p>
<p>If I had to do it again, I&rsquo;d only do the trails on the eastern half, skate over the Hawthorne Bridge, and stick to the paths within the waterfront park. That&rsquo;s not to say I didn&rsquo;t wholly enjoy the rest of it! Many of those parts Keep Portland Weird, as they say.</p>

<title>The Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=40.041753&lon=-78.15071&zoom=12.96">10.4 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/apat1.jpg" alt="Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike" class="poster">
<p>A new bypass on the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened in 1968, redirecting traffic from an 11-mile stretch of the original roadway. The Turnpike Commission eventually sold that stretch to a conservancy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz9HhVMAG8E">for a dollar</a>. Since then, most of that stretch has (unofficially) served as a multi-use path, mostly for bikes. I of course decided to skateboard the entire length, from the southern trailhead in Breezewood to where it merges with the active turnpike, including the two tunnels inbetween.</p>
<p>I started early in the morning from Breezewood, an obese rest stop masquerading as a small town. The new bypass coincided with a new freeway, I-70, both of which converged at this unfortunate point. The whole thing is so convoluted, it&rsquo;s compelled The New York Times to write about it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/01/us/turnpike-journal-born-as-place-to-rest-town-doesn-t.html">at least</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/us/18trucker.html">three</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/us/politics/a-pennsylvania-highway-town-at-the-junction-of-politics-and-policy.html">times</a>. There&rsquo;s a tiny piece of the abandoned turnpike south of the trailhead here, but it looked like a resting place for dead trucks on Google Maps and I didn&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, I felt the full &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; effect. Two lanes in each direction, separated by an overgrown median, with cracks and potholes and weeds. Every once in a while, a peek at the Alleghenies through a clearing in the trees. And no sound other than birds and the wind. Everything I read about the trail liked to point out that it&rsquo;s where <em>The Road</em> was filmed, but it didn&rsquo;t look post-apocalyptic in the morning sunlight. The first stretch was only slightly uphill, and the pavement conditions were better than expected. When one section got rough, I could usually hop over the median where it was better on the other side. I made it to the first tunnel pretty quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/apat2.jpg" alt="Rays Hill Tunnel" class="left">It&rsquo;s clear the two tunnels along this road are the main attractions. The first is Rays Hill Tunnel, a dark semicircle cut out of the mountainside that appears after a bend. The entry face is covered in the same graffiti as the rest of the trail: anti-this, anti-that, and hundreds of penises. From the mouth, I could see the light at the other end &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rays_Hill_Tunnel">Wikipedia says</a> it&rsquo;s about 1km long &mdash; though it was still very necessary to use a headlamp. The pavement inside both tunnels was the smoothest of the entire trail, except for where chunks of wall or ceiling had crumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>The stretch between the tunnels was a decent downhill, and the roads were good enough that I could control my speed by gently carving back and forth, again recalling Walter Mitty from the one scene in its trailer that I remember. For the entire length of the trail from Breezewood north to the active turnpike, I saw no other people. There was one deer, off in the distance, that disappeared into the forest before I reached it.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/apat3.jpg" alt="Sideling Hill Tunnel" class="right">The second tunnel, Sideling Hill Tunnel, is twice as long and ten times as spooky. No visible light at the end for most of it. A constant drip of water coming out of a leak in the ceiling near the beginning. And once I was far enough in, if I stood still, even the silence seemed to echo. The skateboard was super loud and rattly otherwise, amplified by the tunnel&rsquo;s acoustics.</p>
<p>Again, my headlamp was a godsend, illuminating enough of the couple feet in front of me to keep me heading straight and avoid any junk on the ground. It also created opportunities for the tunnel to freak me out&mdash;as once-operating freeway, there were of course little reflectors embedded in lane markers. Most of them are gone now, but every once in a while one in the distance would beam back at me like an eye. And every time, I&rsquo;d go through the possibilities: bear, ghost, standing water filling up a sinkhole that will swallow me. Just as I was getting used to the ones on the road, another would pop out from the walls, in a little recess that maybe was for a fire extinguisher or call box (I don&rsquo;t know). I gasped so hard at one of those that my hot humid breath turned to steam in the cold tunnel, whooshing by the beam of the headlamp.</p>
<p>The last bit of Sideling Hill Tunnel goes under the current active turnpike, though I couldn&rsquo;t hear it at all. After that, it was another nice downhill stretch that passed an abandoned rest stop off the westward lanes. It&rsquo;s a large expanse of open flat concrete, with an overgrown island of trees and shrubs in the middle. I foraged a couple steps in and saw one or two chunks of the old plaza&rsquo;s foundation, and nothing much else. And then only a little way farther, the trail came to an abrupt end.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/apat4.jpg" alt="Road block" class="center">
<p>This was much sooner than I expected, so I hopped the fence and scrambled down an embankment to a small country road below. (Apparently, the turnpike used to take a bridge over this road.) The trail clearly picked up again on the other side of the road, though this time beyond <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0485599,-78.0940682,3a,60y,117.37h,81.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sr3td3wp60X1Mb9qaFE2ogA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">giant PRIVATE ROADWAY</a> signs. Nevertheless, I went through the ineffective gate and continued. This stretch was in noticeably worse shape, and I had to walk a lot of it. Despite the slower pace, it didn&rsquo;t take much time before I reached another dead end. This time, it looked like a slightly elevated country road was paved over the abandoned turnpike after it closed. Still undeterred, I climbed the embankment, crossed the road, and descended&hellip;to a farm.</p>
<p>The trail once again picked up on the other side of the road, though I had to pass a chicken coop to get back on it. This was by far the worst stretch, with torn-up asphalt and downed trees, that eventually gave way to the current, active turnpike.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/apat5.jpg" alt="Northern terminus" class="center">
<p class="caption">it was seriously this small gate and then right into 70mph traffic</p>
<p>The Turnpike Commission stores trucks and other equipment, plus road debris like branches, along this ramp. There was a cop car parked at the merge point, either setting a speed trap or watching for tresspassers like me, so I took a photo and hastily turned around. Indeed, as I learned while writing this, all the land from the first dead end to here is private property and not to be skateboarded on. Whoops.</p>
<p>Is it a commonly-known phenomenon that the first time you do something feels like it takes longer than any subsequent time? That was certainly the case for my return journey, even if it was into a mild headwind. I took a break at the former rest stop on the way back for lunch, which seemed appropriate. Approaching the longer tunnel on the way back, the headwind turned into a twenty-foot-wide gust of supercooled air, kind of like feeling a store&rsquo;s air conditioning spill onto the street, only way more massive.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/apat6.jpg" alt="Sideline Hill control room" class="left">Before I started back through the tunnel, I saw three people coming down the side of the mountain, having just explored the control room at the top. These are also &ldquo;strictly off limits&rdquo; unless you&rsquo;re with a <a href="http://www.pike2bike.com/guided-tours.html">guided tour</a>, so I didn&rsquo;t feel too compelled to look in. I imagine it&rsquo;s not much different than the locked access rooms at the ground level. You stick your head through the window, admire the graffiti and water damage, and keep moving.</p>
<p>About a third of the way back through this tunnel, I saw a pinpoint of light in the distance. Obviously, it was another person wearing a headlamp, approaching from the other end, but what if it wasn&rsquo;t? It was completely dark so I couldn&rsquo;t see any shape around the light, and it steadily grew bigger and closer. This is the kind of thing I&rsquo;d roll my eyes at in a movie, and yet I was so nervous in real life. Then it turned out to of course be a guy on his bike, and we passed each other without a word. Maybe he felt the same way.</p>
<p>What were fun downhills on the way out were arduous uphills on the way back, with the headwind and stronger sun. I saw a couple more people, including two other guys who passed me on their bikes. &ldquo;Skateboard?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Then a much more relaxed passage through the shorter tunnel, serving as a little bit of air cooling more than anything else, and a gentle downhill back to the trailhead.</p>
<p>This was all very cool to experience, especially to see all the green mountain topography after living in relative flatness for a while. All of the trail open for recreational use is definitely doable by skateboard, for anyone else wanting to explore. Or bike, or walk! I say it&rsquo;s worth it, even if you have to drive through Breezewood.</p>

<title>Day 37: Sugarloaf Key - Key West</title>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=24.611943&lon=-81.583207&zoom=12.19">25.2 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day37.jpg" alt="S Roosevelt Blvd" class="center">
<p>One thing about camping, especially solo, is that your circadian rhythm really takes over. I started trying to fall asleep shortly after sunset last night, and woke up a little bit before sunrise this morning. It didn&rsquo;t hurt that I was also eager to get back on the road.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Station outside Key West was putting on a show (or training, sure) as I passed. Three fighter jets kept taking off, circling, and landing right over my head, completely drowning out my headphones. I came close to drifting out of the shoulder and into the traffic lane as my head rolled back to follow them across the sky.</p>
<p>I reached the island with still a lot of morning left, and around mile marker 3, I ran into a breast cancer 5K walk. Looking and smelling dirty, trying to weave through a sea of slower-moving pink, was not how I envisioned finishing this trip, but you take what you get.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m done! Two installments to skateboard from Durham to Key West, and no cheating by car whatsoever this time. Will I tackle the northern half of the East Coast Greenway? I dunno. The first order of business is to throw away these shoes. They may have carried me these 1000+ miles and given me questionable tan lines, but they are falling apart and also gave me some serious blisters. And then I&rsquo;ll enjoy the island for a couple days. No doubt it&rsquo;s all been worth it.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day36.jpg" alt="Old Bahia Honda bridge" class="center">
<p>Let me first pat myself on the back. Today began with the Seven Mile Bridge, on the shoulder of US 1, and I practically flew over it! I didn&rsquo;t walk once, even on the incline and decline in the middle, and I only stopped once to take photos of Pigeon Key, never to catch my breath or steel my nerves. Adrenaline for sure played a big part in getting me through it.</p>
<p>Then it was a network of trails and shoulder hugging through many of the lower keys. About half the bridges had pedestrian counterparts, which were closed. No matter, I can do the biggest bridge with traffic, so I can certainly do the smaller ones. Watching the old railroad bridge follow me in parallel by Bahia Honda was pretty cool, even if there was no way to get on it myself (though I tried &mdash; see photo).</p>
<p>Now my tent is pitched at an oceanside Koa and I&rsquo;m going to spend the rest of the day at their tiny manmade beach. Key West is tomorrow.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day35.jpg" alt="Grassy Key" class="center">
<p>Best laid plans, and whatever. I&rsquo;m calling today a functional rest day, since I&rsquo;d planned on shorter mileage to give me time to explore the Old Seven Mile Bridge and Pigeon Key. But, the old bridge is closed to pedestrians until April or something, and the last ferry to Pigeon Key left about twenty minutes before I arrived. And yeah, I could&rsquo;ve looked this all up ahead of time and planned better, but I didn&rsquo;t! Vacation mode! Who cares!</p>
<p>The skating today was the easiest so far. It might&rsquo;ve been the two preemptive Advil I took with breakfast, whatever popped in my right hip halfway through like a cracked knuckle, or that my muscles are simply catching up to the demands I&rsquo;m putting on them. The real Seven Mile Bridge is tomorrow morning!</p>

<p>They say you can either be a mountains person or a beach person. I got nothing against mountains, but the fact that I&rsquo;m taking this trip itself should be proof enough that I&rsquo;m a beach person. And after today, I think anyone who confidently answers beach person owes it to themselves to travel the keys by some human-powered method. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be skateboard. Driving through is good too but you&rsquo;ll appreciate more at the slower pace and having the direct connection to the land.</p>
<p>There was a nice paved path parallel to the freeway for most of today, except for a stretch over a short key where the road and sidewalk were both under construction. And other than that blip, it was easy! No stress from competing for space with traffic, agreeable weather, and of course gorgeous views. There were times when the land wasn&rsquo;t much wider than the road, with little buffer strips of vegetation, and then ocean to either horizon.</p>

<title>Day 33: Cutler Bay - Key Largo</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=25.265434&lon=-80.380778&zoom=10.51">40.1 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day33.jpg" alt="Marina Del Mar" class="center">
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to the seven mile bridge after Marathon as the biggest and most exciting (in both good and bad ways) challenge of this trip. It&rsquo;s just a bridge for US 1, hopefully a shoulder, and nowhere to go but forward. I overlooked the stretch of US 1 between the city of Homestead and Key Largo: 20 miles long without anything to do except go forward. That was certainly a challenge.</p>
<p>The day began back on the bike trail up until Homestead. It was overcast and smooth sailing, minus some fallen nuts and branches. As the end of the trail approached, I thought &ldquo;lord, it&rsquo;d be nice to start the next leg with a tailwind.&rdquo; And the Good Lord heard me, and it rained for five minutes followed by a mild headwind.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I merged onto the freeway shoulder and locked myself into nothing but the repetitive motions of my legs and the thoughts in my head for the next twenty miles. A couple people honked (encouragingly, I think) during the stretch. The monotony made it feel longer than it was. A sign which read &ldquo;Crocodile crossing next 6 miles&rdquo; set up probably the most terrifying minutes of my life &mdash; what would I even do? &mdash; and thankfully no crocodiles did.</p>
<p>There was of course a visitor center immediately after crossing a bridge onto the island, and I stopped for a water break. Then it was a breezy seven mile skate into the heart of the island. And then, a first: no less than 500 feet from my destination, I was hit by a car. I think I&rsquo;m 100% okay. It was off the main road at an intersection, I had the right of way (though I guess I could&rsquo;ve been more cautious) and a pickup truck already stopped at the stop sign started out, right into me. The hood hit me in the right arm and knocked me on my back (landed on my pack, so lucky), and the front passenger wheel looks like it rolled over my board, with no real damage. The guy got out, apologized and gave me his card. He works for a hotel company in Miami. I said maybe I&rsquo;d contact him the next time I come through, and he said he could find me a job.</p>

<title>Day 32: Hollywood - Cutler Bay</title>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=25.779832&lon=-80.224974&zoom=10.64">46.5 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day32.jpg" alt="Miami Beach boardwalk" class="center">
<p>I went 12 miles beyond what I planned to today, thanks to some of the best skating conditions I&rsquo;ve had on both trips. The sky was overcast most of the day, so the sun and heat weren&rsquo;t oppressive, and the last 17 miles were on a network of real, paved bike trails.</p>
<p>Before that, of course, I skated the shoulder of A1A coming out of Hollywood. Early in the morning, I heard a siren approaching behind me and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to do for a couple seconds. Do I stop where I am, next to the curb? Can I maybe keep going (I&rsquo;m small!)? I ended up hopping the curb onto the sidewalk.
Between Hollywood and Miami was a short trail in Haulover Beach. There were probably a dozen stray cats lounging in the grass on the side, completely unfazed by the human traffic, and every so often a sign asking people to not abandon their pets at the beach. 😿</p>
<p>The late morning had me go through Miami Beach and then Miami proper. I didn&rsquo;t feel like stopping that early in the day, which led to me realizing that everyone else in Miami Beach is there to stay for a little while. I alternated between boardwalks, sidewalks, and the street, and everywhere there were people moving at a vacation pace. No one was pleased to have a stinky skateboarder hurry by.</p>
<p>After crossing into downtown Miami, I got lost. Who knew SE 4th street turns into SE 3rd street somewhere, instead of keeping its name the whole time? I stopped for lunch after I finally got out of the city. And after lunch and the second wind that comes with it, I spent the rest of the day on those trails. The first half was The Underline &mdash; as The High Line in Manhattan is a trail built on an old elevated railway, The Underline in Miami is a trail built under an active one. Pretty smart use of space. Maybe I should become a civil engineer for this very specific niche of bike- and skateboard-friendly urban trails, given how much they excite me.</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s my last night on the mainland! Aiming for Key Largo tomorrow. The key preparation will be to queue more podcasts, which have really helped the miles pass the last two days.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day31.jpg" alt="Ft. Lauderdale beach" class="center">
<p>The first 75% of today&rsquo;s route was straight down A1A, mostly on the shoulder going with traffic. Sunday morning must be when all the South Florida cyclists decide to flock in big groups up and down that road. To that point, I stopped for a Gatorade around 9am, on the heels of three such dudes, clad in their sponsored spandex. They were the first on this trip to give me the up and down and ask me how far I was going, and they all thought I was crazy. One in particular was pretty generous with the f word, especially after I said I&rsquo;d previously come to Florida from North Carolina.</p>
<p>The morning continued smoothly after that, especially once I reached Fort Lauderdale. The road surface in particular was glassy smooth and there was a nice wide bike lane set aside for me and various hordes of cyclists. And some spectacular roadkill. Frogs, for better or worse, retain their general shape after a car runs them over. Three-foot-long iguanas, however, seem to explode. I didn&rsquo;t actually figure it out until I saw a second one. And don&rsquo;t worry, I saw like thirty more live ones over the course of the day.</p>
<p>After Fort Lauderdale the city, I went around Fort Lauderdale the airport. And this was really right up next to it, first weaving around on and off ramps for the interstate, merging with highway-speed cars for that first hit of adrenaline. Then a backwoods road around the perimeter, at one point parallel to a raised runway.</p>
<p>The final stretch was back toward the ocean and over the intracoastal one last time. It was no more than two miles, but felt like ten, thanks to the strong headwind coming off the coast. Forgot how rough those can be.</p>
<p>Fun fact: a great way to immediately find out where all the blisters on your feet are is to jump into the salty ocean.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=26.58739&lon=-79.997214&zoom=10.57">37 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day30.jpg" alt="West Palm Beach boardwalk" class="center">
<p>Let&rsquo;s call this day 30, a continuation of the trip I took two years ago, instead of starting over. Because shortly after setting out this morning, so much felt familiar: focusing intently on the topography twenty feet in front of me and anything making noise behind me, the weight of the pack, the relief of smooth pavement and the agony when it turns coarse. The clickity clack of each sidewalk crack that permeates to my joints. How my right hand fidgets with the closed loop at the end of the waist strap, turning it into a heart and unwinding it again.</p>
<p>Just like the first day of the last trip, the last piece of music I heard looped relentlessly for an hour or so. Unfortunately, this time it was Ants Marching, from a Vine I watched at breakfast. Completely unlike the first day of the last trip, I didn&rsquo;t fall once, and certainly did not end the day in the hospital.</p>
<p>It took a little under an hour to get to PGA Boulevard, which is what we use for the on ramp to 95 South, proving the theory of relativity once more. I started in the shoulder of A1A going with traffic, and quickly discovered that&rsquo;s where cleanup crews are pushing all the debris from Hurricane Matthew. So I switched back and forth between that, the shoulder against traffic, and the sidewalk. For the whole day, really!</p>
<p>After crossing the intracoastal a little south of Palm Beach (all three of the city&rsquo;s bridges for this were under construction, by the way), A1A became millionaires&rsquo; row, one sprawling waterfront mansion estate after another. I ran out of water around mile 25, something to keep in mind for these next few days! Good thing this is civilization, with places to fill up or buy a Gatorade not too far apart. But I definitely took extended breaks at each of those stops, and am feeling it now! I&rsquo;m going to sleep well tonight. It&rsquo;s kinda bizarre (and I&rsquo;m very fortunate) that only two nights ago, I was trying to fall asleep while a hurricane blew by. It sounded like a freight train was idling outside, more like powerful machinery humming than a whoosh.</p>

<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>This article is two combined brain dumps that percolated for a couple months as I fell out of love with Silicon Valley, moved across the country, and started exercising as one of many ways to come out of depression.</p>
<h2>Just</h2>
<p>Everything is always happening <em>right now</em> in the tech world, and everything is important. I follow some tech news on Twitter, from TechCrunch to Pando and Recode to The Verge, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bsuto/status/58537928225333248">they often craft their headlines to grab attention</a>. This is nothing new, nor something to outright condemn &mdash; it&rsquo;s certainly no worse than Upworthy and its peers, who based their entire identity on exclamatory clickbait headlines. But the one practice I wish they all would stop is sprinkling the word <em>Just</em> before every past-tense verb.</p>
<p>It creates an artificial immediacy for things that will not matter in a week and probably don&rsquo;t even matter that much right now. This was the era of FarmVille invitations, remember. And if the littlest things demand your attention so that you know what Just happened, the more important things have to be treated with even more importance, and it all cascades until everything is cartoonishly relevant. In these later years of more established social media practices, when tweets are reposted later in the day for those who missed it, the Just no longer applies and the tweets are either laughably outdated, or rewritten to be more sensibly timeless and how they should have been in the first place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first Just that bothered me in tech. The other Just usually came from within, though I saw it in other people. The first Just was about establishing immediacy and importance; the second was about diminishing those! More and more frequently, I heard myself couching all my contributions in meetings, or requests for work or collaboration in emails, with a Just. &ldquo;I was just wondering if you could take a look at the API keys under this account?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just my opinion, but this policy is kinda dumb.&rdquo; And so on.</p>
<p>Perhaps feeling bombarded by the first Just led to me adopting the second Just too much: if everything out there is important, maybe what I have to offer isn&rsquo;t. Of course, for that pathway to be there, there already has to be something inside me worth working out in therapy (which I eventually did), but once I realized I didn&rsquo;t like it, I began to realize I didn&rsquo;t like much of where I was and what I was doing. So I left, in an abrupt way.</p>
<h2>Do It Again</h2>
<p>I moved from the Bay Area to South Florida; from behind a screen and a desk to forcing myself to be outside as much as possible. To this day, I maintain it&rsquo;s the healthiest I&rsquo;ve ever been in my adult life. I cooked for myself (whether this was always healthy is debatable), I saw a therapist, and went through <a href="https://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/90343/couch-to-5k-plan">a couch-to-10k program I found online</a>.</p>
<p>The first couple days were brutal. It was early autumn in Florida, still high heat and humidity, and I was truly starting from a couch level of fitness. On that first day, which was laughably easy looking back, I was short of breath and a puddle of sweat. I wasn&rsquo;t wearing any kind of specialized clothing (and not that you have to, but it sure helps), and I threw away the soaked Target-brand boxers as soon as I returned home.</p>
<p>By the end of the third week, I was committed. I wouldn&rsquo;t say hooked, because I still needed to motivate myself to do it, but I was in deep enough that I didn&rsquo;t want to quit. (Sunk cost fallacy!) So I created structures and rewards: after every run, I would go to the community pool with my new Kindle, cool down, read for pleasure, and nap in the sun. The running turned into an extended period of outside time, which always left me feeling better. The promise of this, waiting for me at the end, was enough to get me out there and started every day.</p>
<p>Then there was the issue of getting a mile or so into the run, starting to feel tired, and wanting to give up. Maybe it would be especially hot or humid, or maybe there&rsquo;d be a headwind that sapped all forward momentum, or maybe it was the itty-bitty hill (seriously, 10 feet high?) at the half-mile marker. Around week three, a mile was more or less halfway through the daily distance. And so I started telling myself, I&rsquo;ve done that much already, I just need to do it again.</p>
<p>I know this isn&rsquo;t a novel idea. On a two mile run, I hit one mile, and I say just do that again. I hit 1.5 miles, I say just do that half mile again. I hit 1.75 miles, I say just do that quarter mile again. There were only signs every quarter mile on that track, otherwise I&rsquo;d probably keep doing it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/2_%2B_1/4_%2B_1/8_%2B_1/16_%2B_⋯">to infinity</a>. But at some point it hit me: the second Just, where this thing I&rsquo;m about to suggest isn&rsquo;t that important, had redeemed itself.</p>

<title>Pastecard State of the Company, 2016</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/pastecard-sotc-2016.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>YAU steady at 1</li>
<li>Version 1.3 deployed in January to great success</li>
<li>Revenue burn rate reduced by 67%</li>
</ul>
<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Pastecard formally launched in Q4 2010 in Palo Alto, California. In Q1 2012, the company moved its headquarters to Carrboro, North Carolina and is still happily operating there.</p>
<h3>Staff</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brian Sutorius,</strong> Founder, CEO, CFO, CTO, Head Counsel, micro-kitchen stockboy</li>
<li><strong>Hudson the koala puppet,</strong> Chairman of the Board</li>
</ul>
<h3>An aside on diversity</h3>
<p>Diversity is an incredibly important issue, especially at technology-focused companies. Unfortunately, Pastecard ranks among the least diverse companies in the world. 100% of the staff identifies as a white, heterosexual, cisgender male, from a liberal Christian upbringing in a suburban middle class household. Obviously this is something the company would like to improve.</p>
<h2>Product Engineering</h2>
<h3>Celebrating Version 1.3</h3>
<p>Pastecard was completely rewritten in January 2016. From its public launch in 2010 until this rewrite, each user had its own subdirectory on the server, containing its own copy of the application code. In the new architecture, Pastecard actually works as a true web application, with only one instance of the code and a centralized database from which each user&rsquo;s data is requested. In keeping with the company&rsquo;s tradition of sloppy laziness, the database is a directory of plain text files and nothing serious.</p>
<h3>A Requiem for Stupidity</h3>
<p>To support the previous architecture, where each new Pastecard user had its own  instance of the application, the sign up workflow would have to create a new directory in the Pastecard filesystem and execute dangerously dumb <span class="code">chmod</span> commands, at the root level, each time. Code changes were deployed by copying and pasting the changes to each copy of the application across all the subdirectories, using an FTP program&rsquo;s built-in text editor. Metrics such as total user count were gathered by counting the number of folders listed in the FTP program&rsquo;s list view. It is a wonder anything worked at all.</p>
<p>With the new architecture, there is also now a web admin interface for all user operations and data gathering. Because it is 2016, the interface is responsive, meaning Pastecard employees can address user support tickets completely from their phones. So, when that first user support ticket comes in, we&rsquo;ll be ready.</p>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li>YAU <em>(yearly active users)</em> in 2015: <strong>1</strong></li>
<li>New users in 2015: <strong>0</strong></li>
<li>Page views in 2015: <strong>hard to say</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>A look ahead</h3>
<p>Already in 2016, a bug (usernames were foolishly case sensitive) has caused our new users metric to falsely inflate. One user who had signed up with a capital letter in their username tried returning to their Pastecard using all lowercase characters (boosting our YAU up to 2), assumed their account had been deleted, and created a new account with the same username in all lowercase. The bug has been fixed, the two accounts have been merged, and the responsible engineer has been banished to <a href="http://the-witness.net">a remote island</a>.</p>
<p>The company expects new user signups to remain stalled at 0, YAU to not climb above the anomalous 2, and page views to remain a mystery only accessible to those rare wizards who know how to use a computer.</p>
<h2>Financials</h2>
<h3>Operating Expenses</h3>
<p>Pastecard switched web hosts simultaneously with the release of version 1.3. The previous host cost the company $25 a year, and the new host is completely free for the same level of service. It helps that the total size of the Pastecard product (application code, user data, admin interface, favicons) is under 50K. Bandwidth is probably in the same ballpark per month. It is a joke that the company had to pay for such infinitesimal requirements in the first place.</p>
<p>The company still has to pay approximately $12 each year to maintain its domain name registration. And employees are still only compensated with the promise of stock options; no actual salaries or benefit packages are distributed whatsoever. In sum, our operating expenses for 2016 ($12) will be only a third of what they were in 2015 ($37). This marks the only true recognizable progress in the company&rsquo;s entire history.</p>
<h3>Revenue</h3>
<p>Pastecard makes no money.</p>
<h3>Outside Investment</h3>
<p>In Q4 2012, Pastecard applied for $37 in venture capital funding from the <a href="https://static.pinboard.in/prosperity_cloud.htm">Pinboard Investment Co-Prosperity Cloud</a> and was rightly rejected.</p>
<p>From Q2 2015 to Q4 2015, Pastecard was subsumed (i.e. acquired for no money) into Fat Toast, a consulting firm also in Carrboro. This company actually made real money, but still operated in the red for its eight-month life span. It was dissolved in October 2015, and Pastecard was spun off back into its own entity.</p>
<h4>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL</h4>
<p>In 2016, the company will explore a new revenue stream: sponsored demo videos. Almost all technology products pride themselves on a polished video showing how to use the related hardware or software, and Pastecard wants to be one of them. We plan to open up creative and directorial rights to the highest bidder; allowing them to use product placement for their own goods in our demo video as they desire. If the idea attracts many suitors, we will entertain the idea of creating many sponsored demo videos, as we count our money from a golden standing desk.</p>

<title>Day 29: Ft. Pierce - Jupiter</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/day29.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=27.096347&lon=-80.226506&zoom=10.28">49.3 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day29.jpg" alt="Hobe Sound trail" class="center">
<p>I picked my grandpa&rsquo;s place in Jupiter as a finish point for a couple reasons. I was living here (temporarily as a retiree myself) when I first had the idea for the trip. Also, my family has been coming here (usually for spring break) for longer than I can remember. It&rsquo;s a special place.</p>
<p>When we would come down as a family, it involved a through-the-night drive from Cleveland. My grandpa&rsquo;s complex has four tall buildings and one squat one (he&rsquo;s in the latter). A couple miles out, we can see the tops of the four tall ones, and that&rsquo;s when everything hits us: the drive is almost over, vacation is about to begin, we&rsquo;re nearly there. 3&ndash;4 miles from finishing my personal journey, and approaching from the north instead of the west, I saw the same four tops today. That moment hit me harder than actually coming to a stop and walking in the door.</p>
<p>Along the way today there were a couple other things, like a nice stretch north of Hobe Sound on white cement over white sand (photo). And after my building-tops moment but still three miles out, I passed a bench between the road and the beach where I skated to three years ago, seeing if my then-new idea had any legs. From that bench to the finish line, I got to retrace those miles exactly (even though the ECG would&rsquo;ve had me go a more direct way). I could remember how scary the hill was, how nervous I was going on the shoulder of US 1 even for an instant. All that seemed like everyday happenings this time. (To be fair, I was wearing flip flops like an idiot the first time.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel any different, mentally or physically, beyond the obvious aches that come after a day of repetitive motions. This is the ultimate cliché, but it all went by so fast. For sure, this is one of the coolest things I&rsquo;ve ever done, and maybe it doesn&rsquo;t need to be any more than that.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=27.711601&lon=-80.484388&zoom=10.09">53.4 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day28.jpg" alt="Sunrise from a penthouse room" class="center">
<p>Fifty miles! When I watched the sun rise this morning from my baller hotel room, I knew that was ahead of me but didn&rsquo;t really know what it&rsquo;d feel like. It could be the distance in general, but I posit that going over thousands of jolting sidewalk cracks caused more aches than some previous days put together.</p>
<p>On the positive side, I got confirmation of double digit speed today! One of those speed limit / your actual speed signs flickered between 10 and 11 as I went by, though it was admittedly on a slight decline. Later, a man out for exercise on his bicycle caught up to me, and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tailing you for a while, you&rsquo;re going ten to eleven miles per hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be my last day, and a relatively easy one compared to these last couple (hopefully). Like this morning, I know that&rsquo;s ahead of me but I doubt I can predict what it&rsquo;ll feel like to finish.</p>

<title>Day 27: Titusville - Indialantic</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/day27.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=28.395996&lon=-80.703278&zoom=10.44">43.2 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day27.jpg" alt="Dock" class="center">
<p>First thing this morning, I could see the sun rising over the Vehicle Assembly Building across the water. It was inspiring as I rode US 1 out of Titusville. Pretty quickly, I ran into some infamous Florida orange barrels, as they were resurfacing the highway. It clearly deserved it, it was bad as the 242 in NC. However, my legs are noticeably stronger now and I was able to power through / over the pebbles. They made my board bounce so much that I got tossed off once. It was going to be rough, so I checked the northbound lanes and noticed they were already finished. So I crossed over and went against traffic for the first leg, instead of with it.</p>
<p>Between Titusville and Cocoa was a nice stretch of residential waterfront homes, each with its own slip onto the intracoastal (photo). Then Cocoa was a series of strip malls, and then following that was a series of golf-centric gated communities. It was kind of impressive and kind of repulsive how many there were.</p>
<p>Then I crossed a big bridge over the intracoastal (again) to finish the day back on the Atlantic in Indialantic. On the way down the bridge, in a protected pedestrian lane all to myself, I sat on the board and flew down like a one man bobsled team. To the cars driving over, they probably only saw the top of a helmet over the cement railing, smoothly keeping pace with them. I hope someone laughed.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day26.jpg" alt="Space View Park" class="center">
<p>I felt more sleepy today than usual. I almost took a lazy Sunday nap on a park bench overlooking the intracoastal in Edgewater.</p>
<p>At the height of my obsession with space (around the time Apollo 13 came out), my family went to Kennedy Space Center. And today I had to travel inland because this is that stretch of the coast reserved for NASA, Cape Canaveral! It meant a return to form, occupying the shoulder of a highway (this time, US 1) and cutting through a flat stretch of land with not much but the sun beating down.</p>
<p>My brother Jack is heading to Jupiter for a couple days, so I have a narrow time window for the end of this trip. This means I won&rsquo;t indulge the part of me that still wants to be an astronaut today or tomorrow, but maybe I&rsquo;ll drive a rental car home instead of flying, so I can stop back here on the way up. Harry Potter world is across the 95 from here as well!</p>
<p>Fun trivia tidbit: the area code for the Cape Canaveral area is 321. Blast off!</p>

<title>Day 25: St. Augustine Beach - Daytona Beach</title>

<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=29.409095&lon=-81.157028&zoom=10">47.9 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day25.jpg" alt="A1A around Flagler Beach" class="center">
<p>Today was one of the longest in terms of mileage so far, but it felt relatively quick. Almost all of it was on wide sidewalks, along A1A and other roads. For the first hour or two, a strategic line of palm trees sat between me and the rising sun, allowing me to cruise in the shade. When the ground flattened out and the trees went away, I decided to finally try listening to podcasts with one earbud in. And it totally helped!</p>
<p>I never missed a pedestrian or car coming up behind me, my muscle memory kept me pushing, and my mind was occupied. Not thinking constantly about the trip and the road made a huge difference. Unfortunately, I blew through most of my podcast queue just today.</p>
<p>Before hitting the city limits of Daytona Beach, I passed through Ormond Beach. Surprisingly after a random intersection, I found myself on a path through a courtyard of The Casements, Rockefeller&rsquo;s old winter home. He had a pretty nice view of the intracoastal. This has been a good state to go through for many reasons, and the amount of historical places is one of them.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=30.011571&lon=-81.355604&zoom=10.34">37.5 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day24.jpg" alt="Castillo de San Marcos" class="center">
<p>Almost all of today&rsquo;s miles were down A1A, which can be both a town&rsquo;s main drag with wall-to-wall strip malls, and an isolated highway with light traffic through oceanfront state parks. After more of the latter, I crossed a big bridge into St. Augustine.</p>
<p>I stopped at a small pizza place for lunch. On my way out, the owner asked me if I was on a big trip, since my pack had &ldquo;those serious straps.&rdquo; When I replied yes, and that I&rsquo;d started in North Carolina, I could almost see the tiny poof in his head as his mind was blown. His eyes got wide at least. &ldquo;I thought maybe you were coming from Jacksonville or something!&rdquo; When I said that Jacksonville was where I had started that morning, his mind was blown again.</p>
<p>Then I got to pass through the historic part of the city. Moving south, the first thing was the Fountain of Youth tourist trap. I didn&rsquo;t pay the entry fee so I didn&rsquo;t get to slurp any of their sulfur water, but I did use the public restrooms to pee. And as a young man still under 30, that made me the fountain of youth for a couple seconds.</p>
<p>Next was the mission and shrine to Our Lady of La Leche, with the accompanying 200ft tall cross. I skated by.</p>
<p>Finally, the big fort, Castillo de San Marcos. The dry moat and outer grounds are open like a public park, and really cool to wander around. They were charging to go inside, which I vaguely remember doing more than twenty years ago, so I opted to continue around the perimeter. It was still awesome to see the old walls and towers from the outside.</p>
<p>Then I crossed the [draw]bridge of lions to move further south and away from the tourist area. A fairly long day on the coastal roads tomorrow!</p>

<p>How am I ever going to get anywhere, if I&rsquo;m stopping all the time to take pictures? You can think the people of Florida are a collective goof troop (politicians and otherwise), but there&rsquo;s no denying the weather and scenery are gorgeous.</p>
<p>The first hour today was eastward. Given that I try to set out shortly after sunrise, this meant I was facing directly into the sun as it rose. Too bad I didn&rsquo;t pack any sunglasses.</p>
<p>Once I crossed a bridge into Amelia Island, I began an absolutely beautiful stretch mostly along separate bike paths, through the island and onto Big and Little Talbot islands. It finished with a quick ferry ride back to the mainland, the ECG logo displayed proudly on the side.</p>
<p>Then it was through a series of strip malls (and strip clubs) to get around Jacksonville city limits and finally back out to the Atlantic coast. I threw my stuff in the room and dove into the ocean.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day22.jpg" alt="Florida state line" class="center">
<p>Today is really a combination rest and celebration day. There are plenty of people who&rsquo;ve heard I&rsquo;m &ldquo;skateboarding to Florida,&rdquo; and as far as they&rsquo;re concerned, I&rsquo;ve done it!</p>
<p>The morning was easy, some Georgia back roads and then the 17, over a big blue bridge (which was closed until recently, according to the ECG) into the sunshine state. I continued along the 17 until Yulee. This stretch was also recently paved, but they hadn&rsquo;t gotten to the shoulders yet. After I passed an active construction zone where only one lane could go at a time, it was walking when traffic was going my way and skating on fresh asphalt with the lane to myself when they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Last night at a gas station in Woodbine, I found a single can of Rockstar Cola, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure was discontinued a long time ago. Either way, I bought it and carried it with me across state lines and right past the agricultural inspection stop. That&rsquo;s who I am, you guys: I&rsquo;ll celebrate with an expired energy drink instead of champagne. It didn&rsquo;t even spray when I opened it, despite bumping along for all those miles.</p>
<p>As a final weird celebration, I walked three miles each way to the town shopping center to mail home all my camping gear. I&rsquo;m in a vacation state, may as well go into vacation mode and spend my nights in beachside rooms somehow. Plus, my pack feels essentially weightless as a result. Everything&rsquo;s coming up Brian!</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day21.jpg" alt="Gravelly roads" class="center">
<p>Today started and ended with big bridges. And in between, my body felt like it was day one again. Last night, on a whim, I went to <a href="http://mcintoshchiropractic.com">a chiropractor</a> whose office I&rsquo;d passed when rolling into town. Dr. Payne cracked my neck a couple times, hooked electrodes up to some achy points, used a pressure-wound hammer to &ldquo;whack&rdquo; my right patella back into place (her word!) and otherwise was so cool, generous, and helpful. The aches in my neck, knee, and hip are gone. My knee is now wrapped in fancy athletic tape and feels especially strong and supported. I can&rsquo;t thank her enough!</p>
<p>Between the cities of Waverly and White Oak, there were two stretches of road covered in loose gravel, but the shoulders were cleared. However, it wasn&rsquo;t as good for me as it sounds: there was of course still grit in the shoulder lane, cars passing by spit pebbles back at me and stirred up dust, and when I gave in and started walking I got pebbles in my shoes. In between those two stretches, a group of four through-bikers passed me without really saying hello. They looked to each be carrying more gear than the guy riding solo a couple days ago.</p>
<p>After White Oak, the Georgia Coast Rail-Trail appeared and I decided to take it for a mile or two. It was another old railway turned into forest trail (more walking), far removed from the road and completely in the shade. But there were so many mosquitoes that I gladly got back on the road when it ended.</p>
<p>Sometime tomorrow I should pass into Florida! It&rsquo;s the last border crossing for me but there will still be so much ground to cover.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day20.jpg" alt="Some creek bed" class="center">
<p>Today&rsquo;s route had only two directions: go south on 17 for thirty miles, then turn left at 99 and take it into Darien. It made the day somewhat monotonous, to the point where I even yawned once or twice.</p>
<p>The motel where I stayed last night was on 17, so I began the day right in heavy traffic. I was complimenting myself for being able to do so, but then no fewer than three people passed me on bikes. In the shoulder. Dressed as if they were doing it for morning exercise, definitely not carrying any gear. Sure put me in my place.</p>
<p>At the one intersection where I had to turn, I stopped at a gas station for a gatorade. There was a dollar bill on the floor of the store, which I pointed out to the guy behind the counter. He asked if it was mine, and I said no, so he came out from behind the counter and picked it up. He then bought himself a mega millions lottery ticket with it, ringing up the sale and everything. If he wins, I&rsquo;ll kick myself.</p>
<p>All of highway 99 was recently paved. How recent? I ran into the construction crew doing final touch ups about ten miles in. Some gave me thumbs-up, others asked out loud what I was thinking. Still got it!</p>
<p>With the glass-smooth road surface, light traffic, and overcast sky, I day dreamed a lot for those miles on 99. My legs were on auto pilot, which may come back to bite me. I maintain that I&rsquo;m too far in to consider alternating legs again, but the right one is going to come out of this looking and feeling unusual for sure.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day19.jpg" alt="Pooler Parkway shoulder" class="center">
<p>Another day all on roads, and another quick day thanks to good Georgia road conditions. Though, I did get honked at more times today than any other day this trip. For a while, I wondered if my pack had burst open or something.</p>
<p>The first 13.5 miles flew by in one and a half hours, without needing to stop or even walk. That&rsquo;s by far my record pace for this trip, and at the same time, only 9mph. Oh well!</p>
<p>After Bloomingdale, the ECG goes into Savannah and comes back on the same route before going south. So I&rsquo;d planned on skipping Savannah to avoid covering the same ground twice. But I didn&rsquo;t know how to read a map when I planned my route, and had to improvise my way south today. It led me to the Pooler Parkway, which had grooved pavement in the shoulder. The first setback of the state!</p>
<p>I made it through that segment quickly enough on foot, then turned onto the Atlantic Coastal Highway. It had a bike lane just for me for a few miles! Still, the thing about skating next to highway traffic (whether in a dedicated lane or on the shoulder) is that I implicitly trust every driver with my life. Even more so when there&rsquo;s no shoulder and I have to be in their lane. I know as a driver I&rsquo;ve gotten distracted and veered onto the shoulder, briefly going over the same rumble grooves I walked on today. Really makes me appreciate those don&rsquo;t text and drive PSAs.</p>
<p>Turns out the Atlantic Coastal Highway is my old nemesis, highway 17, in disguise. I&rsquo;ll continue on it for 30+ miles tomorrow. Inching ever closer to that Florida border.</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day18.jpg" alt="Georgia state line" class="center">
<p>So long, South Carolina! Road conditions improved immensely once I got into Georgia. While not a separate bike trail, it looks like I&rsquo;ll be on official bike roads for the entire state. Comfortably wide shoulders and smooth pavement will be just fine. I&rsquo;m over my traffic jitters anyway.</p>
<p>The Jasper county sheriff pulled me over less than a mile before the border. To paraphrase him, he saw me walking (thanks to the rough SC roads wishing me goodbye) with a helmet on, didn&rsquo;t see my skateboard, and wondered if things were okay. I don&rsquo;t want to put words in his mouth, but I think he thought I was a mental patient wandering around. Once he talked to me and saw everything I was carrying, he got back in his car and zoomed away.</p>
<p>A couple miles before Springfield, two dogs bounded off their front porch to chase me. One went right through their fence and caught up quickly. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking, only fight or flight lizard brain stuff was happening, so I stopped and yelled &ldquo;HEY!&rdquo; in its face. It worked!</p>
<p>Tonight, I&rsquo;m staying at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/claudettes-country-kitchen-and-inn-guyton-2">a bed and breakfast</a> run by a very nice woman named Claudette. It&rsquo;s in an old historic southern country house, and she&rsquo;s seen her share of cyclists coming through. She says it makes her happy to be the only safe place between SC and Savannah, but could always use more business. If you&rsquo;re ever in Guyton, stay a night at her place!</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day17.jpg" alt="95, frontage" class="center">
<p class="caption">A tale of two roads: on the left, I-95 south with two lanes of traffic hurtling forward at 70+ mph; on the right, a frontage road with hardly any traffic in either direction.</p>
<p>Today is what a rest day should be (and maybe will be from now on). Minimal distance with good weather, so there&rsquo;s no anxiety about reaching the end before sunset or exhaustion. Even though over half of it was walking due to gritty roads, my mood was as positive as it&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>I met my first fellow ECG traveler on the frontage road. He snuck up behind me on his bike, carrying only two small panniers and a tent. He slowed his pace to match mine, neither of us stopping altogether. We exchanged hellos but not names, starting and ending points. He&rsquo;s going the entire way, having already traveled from the north end of Maine and bound for Key West. He was still impressed that I&rsquo;d come a fraction of his distance, via skateboard. And then like that, we wished each other well and he accelerated past me back to his normal speed.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=32.786559&lon=-80.421458&zoom=11.25">40.6 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day16.jpg" alt="Roadside Grocery Store" class="center">
<p>My original goal was 40 miles a day, which was feasible at the beginning, with cooler temperatures and better road surfaces. But I struggled today to hit 40, spending almost ten hours on the road and a lot of that walking.</p>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/seanwilsey/more-like-a-metaphor">an awesome article</a> the other day about the author&rsquo;s personal history and connection to skateboarding; there was a passage where he called out the people who walk up hills rather than rough it out on the board. I&rsquo;ll own up to being quick to walk on this trip because I&rsquo;m in it for distance and endurance, and when pushing on the board goes no quicker than walking at 2&ndash;3 times the effort, of course I&rsquo;m gonna walk. Maybe my legs aren&rsquo;t strong enough yet.</p>
<p>For the rest of SC, I&rsquo;ll reduce my goal to 30 miles a day and see how that goes. Hopefully Georgia has better roads! I&rsquo;ll be glad to get away from the 17 forever.</p>
<p>I stopped for a soda at Road Side Grocery in Yemassee before reaching my final destination. The friendly woman behind the counter said she&rsquo;d seen a lot of bikes go by, but mine was the first skateboard. One customer kept coming into the store from the picnic benches out back to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t seeing things: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wild, man! Wild.&rdquo; Four times in a row. Another guy pulled up, parked his car, gave me a once-over, and simply said &ldquo;all right&rdquo; before going inside.</p>
<p>Before I set out again, &ldquo;wild!&rdquo; man came by one more time. &ldquo;You gotta be on drugs to be doing this, man!&rdquo; I assured him I wasn&rsquo;t, he asked if I ever did, I answered, and he offered to sell me weed on the spot. What a generous fella!</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day15.jpg" alt="Lakeside campsite" class="center">
<p>For how short today was in mileage, it felt just as long as any previous day. I&rsquo;m camping tonight at what appears to be the only safe place to stop between Charleston and Yemassee, so a short trip today will be followed by a longer one tomorrow.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t take rest days anymore. I come out of them feeling lazy and reticent to move; five of today&rsquo;s first eight miles had to be walked due to muddy gravel paths and I was just fine with that. When I had to end on the shoulder of the 17 again, I was scared and didn&rsquo;t want to, despite what I said after coming into Georgetown. To be fair, this section of 17 had just as heavy traffic but almost no shoulder width, forcing me onto the highway at times.</p>
<p>My campsite tonight is cute but I hope neither mosquitoes nor alligators disturb me. Mostly kidding on the alligators.</p>

<p>Charleston is a phenomenal city. I wandered around the historic district for hours today, seeing gravestones and buildings from the 1700s, tourists and students alike, and an endless amount of delicious-looking restaurants.</p>
<p>I chose to eat lunch at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hello-my-name-is-bbq-charleston">Hello My Name Is BBQ</a>, which started as a food truck, to compare both Carolina styles side by side. I still prefer vinegar over mustard but they also had a &ldquo;green and bold&rdquo; jalapeño-based sauce and that was real good too.</p>
<p>None of the intermittent thunderstorms forecast for today have happened yet, so they&rsquo;ll probably come as I get back on the road tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;ll be back, Charleston!</p>

<title>Day 13: Georgetown - McClellanville</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=33.26768&lon=-79.34548&zoom=11.75">18.6 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day13.jpg" alt="Rainy southern gazebo" class="center">
<p>Time for another asterisk: I got a ride through the Francis Marion park so I&rsquo;m now in Charleston. The mileage above is what I did on my own. But let me start at the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>A foggy mist hung over Georgetown this morning, almost making me doubt the safety of going down the roads. But the ECG route went 14 miles or so around 17 so I decided to take that. For the first three miles, the road was smooth and the skating was easy. But around 9:15 it started raining real hard. All the weather sources said that wouldn&rsquo;t happen until the afternoon! I was incredibly lucky to be close to a place that let me wait it out safe and dry.</p>
<p>Two twenty-somethings were running this combination gas station and bait shop. One had a heavy southern accent, the other none at all. I spent most of my time talking to the former, while the latter rung up the occasional customer. &ldquo;You picked the most redneck town in South Carolina to come through. We don&rsquo;t like people who aren&rsquo;t from Georgetown, but you walked farther than I have so I can&rsquo;t hate.&rdquo; He went on to say that everyone in Georgetown is either working in the mill or &ldquo;shrimpin&rsquo; and crabbin&rsquo;.&rdquo; The other guy piped up to say that a lot of bicyclists pass by their place even though it&rsquo;s way out of the way. I replied that I&rsquo;m probably taking the same route as them. Blue skies emerged and I figured it was safe to continue so I thanked them both for their hospitality and was off.</p>
<p>From that point on, the roads were rough and wet. The rest of those 14 miles were tough enough, and then a second storm caught me off guard. I huddled under a grove of trees until it slowed, figuring I was losing a lot of time if I still had 25+ miles of national forest to get through.</p>
<p>I made it back to 17 and continued for a couple miles in light rain, crossing over the North and South Santee Rivers to enter the park. Coming down the bridge, a red sedan was pulled over with its windows down. The driver motioned for me to come talk to him.</p>
<p>With a couple expletives, he asked what I was doing and where I was going. I looked like I was in bad shape, soaking wet and covered in mud from my knees down. His name was Chad and he insisted on driving me to Charleston. What would have been two days of travel for me whipped by in less than an hour. Chad&rsquo;s a street performer from New Orleans who had driven a friend to Myrtle Beach and was on his way back. &ldquo;But now is all that matters, so if I end up somewhere else, that&rsquo;s okay too.&rdquo; He had his whole life in the back seat, just in case. We talked about living simply and living happily, being content with what you do and what you have. He got off at the first exit in town and I bought him a beer. Then he was off to discover the city for himself. The next time I&rsquo;m in Jackson Square, I&rsquo;ll look for Chad poppin and lockin &mdash; he expects me to.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=33.461092&lon=-79.218409&zoom=11.34">27 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day12.jpg" alt="Forest trail" class="center">
<p>The very morning after I redid the next couple days&rsquo; schedule, to accommodate for the heat and humidity, the temperature dropped over ten degrees and the sun went behind the clouds. So today&rsquo;s short route feels a little cheap because the weather wasn&rsquo;t oppressive at all.</p>
<p>The first leg was on a variety of trails and sidewalks, some smooth and picturesque (above), others rough and bordering golf courses. As for the second leg, I&rsquo;ve been trying to avoid the 17 as much as possible, but it was the only way into Georgetown. So I did over eight miles on the shoulder of the highway, and a for-real highway this time. There were the warning grooves cut into the road between the right lane and the shoulder, constant traffic, and nowhere to exit for those eight miles. I&rsquo;ve done some miles on the shoulder of a major road already but those were only practice for today. And now that it&rsquo;s behind me, I dunno if I can ever be scared again.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to go halfway through the Francis Marion National Forest (and conveniently, set up camp at the Halfway Creek campsite). I don&rsquo;t know if there will be phone service, but I&rsquo;ll still take notes and photos to post on the other side. That&rsquo;ll be the great city of Charleston!</p>

<title>Day 11: North Myrtle Beach - Murrells Inlet</title>

<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=33.718467&lon=-78.935978&zoom=11.42">33 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day11.jpg" alt="The actual beach" class="center">
<p>No fewer than four times did today&rsquo;s official ECG cue sheet say &ldquo;use extreme caution.&rdquo; I even carried the warnings over to my own route sheets. But those segments weren&rsquo;t that scary! The secret is using the sidewalks, which is maybe the first advantage of a skateboard over a bike so far.</p>
<p>I realize that I&rsquo;ve mostly written about road conditions since the first couple days, because it&rsquo;s been most of what I think about as the day wears on. Sad, but true. I&rsquo;ll try and change that.
For example! Today, a guy idling in his truck at the other end of the intersection from me rolled down his window to shout at me, &ldquo;you dropped [something] out of your pocket!&rdquo; While I clearly couldn&rsquo;t hear him very well, I&rsquo;m pretty sure those words were correct. Either way, my shorts don&rsquo;t have pockets. I maintained eye contact with him and shrug-smiled, and he guffawed and replied, &ldquo;made ya look!&rdquo; Then he peeled out.</p>
<p>For whatever reasons, the humidity, the heat, the foot traffic and road traffic, or whatever else, I traveled slowly today. About two thirds of the way in, I stopped at Surfside Beach for lunch at Bubba&rsquo;s Fish Shack, a kitschy seafood place, and dipped my feet in the ocean. There&rsquo;s something about that, feeling the wet sand in between my toes, the cool rush of the water, and the gentle pull as the tide goes back, that always lifts my spirits. It gave me my second wind.</p>
<p>The streets of downtown Surfside Beach (motto: The Family Beach, as opposed to the shenanigans in MB) were closed for classic car day. Two separate old timers, standing next to their old american muscle cars, gave me the &ldquo;hang loose&rdquo; hand gesture as I went past. Still got it!</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day10.jpg" alt="South Carolina state line" class="center">
<p>Myrtle Beach is crazy, and the 17 is scary! Also, it&rsquo;s hot outside. So I&rsquo;m taking this stretch through MB a little easier than planned.</p>
<p>North Carolina is behind me now! The border had a few details that jumped out at me. The sign before the state line simply read &ldquo;Bike Lane &mdash; End&rdquo; and then the road immediately went from smooth to impossibly gritty. I hope conditions get better, but odds are they&rsquo;ll stay this way until Georgia.</p>
<p>Soon after the border I merged onto highway 17. I&rsquo;ve been on highways already but this was different: gritty roads, no shoulder, and constant traffic (two lanes&rsquo; worth each direction). So I started walking on the grass at the side of the road pretty much immediately.</p>
<p>The ECG route included a short detour off 17 that made sense on paper &mdash; a reprieve from the stress of a major road &mdash; but the detour&rsquo;s roads were no better and I ended up walking that too. Then back to 17 for more walking until I could take the bypass to Myrtle Beach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both awesome and frustrating to have Ocean Blvd be a part of the ECG. Awesome to have the ocean right there, frustrating to have a bunch of people and boardwalk shops right there too. More walking mixed in with slow skateboarding. I&rsquo;m calling it for the day, and spending my Friday night in party city (asleep).</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day9.jpg" alt="Fort Fisher Ferry" class="center">
<p>Whatever island or peninsula Wilmington is on sure is bigger than the map would have you think. I crossed one scary bridge over the intracoastal getting out of there, well made up for by later cruising through a beach town and reaching the Atlantic for the first time.</p>
<p>After passing through Fort Fisher, it was time to ride a ferry! I was the only pedestrian so I got to sit in a cabin with the crew while everyone else stayed in their vehicles or milled around the deck. There were two RVs and one crew member pointed out &ldquo;one has three A/C units and a TV satellite dish. Ain&rsquo;t never seen that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I had to say goodbye to the Atlantic and travel back inland to follow the bike-friendly highways. 211 was smooth, relatively flat, relatively free of wind, and traveled by friendly traffic. The final 10 miles, on a mix of residential roads and the main drag through Shallotte, were not as forgiving.</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s my last night in North Carolina. There&rsquo;s still so much ahead!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I needed a rest day today, I easily could have kept going. (I&rsquo;m especially excited to ride a ferry tomorrow to get back on the mainland.) But I did fall asleep reading this afternoon, so maybe I did. Either way, the other Carolina in only two days!</p>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day7.jpg" alt="Empty parking lot" class="center">
<p class="caption">A future housing development&rsquo;s parking lot. If I wasn&rsquo;t tired when I got there, it would&rsquo;ve been perfect for cruising around.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I am writing this from Wilmington. I took a cab from Leland into town because pedestrians are forbidden on the 17 bridge I&rsquo;d eventually have to take. I&rsquo;m a fraud! But the mileage quoted above was all skateboard and walking, I promise.</p>
<p>And what an easy, fast day for skateboarding. None of the route was on the ECG, but a new route I made up last night. The majority of it was on highway 87, which was smooth asphalt, moderate grade, and low wind. Even the traffic was considerate; trucks and cars moved over even though I could stay on the wide shoulder, and one guy even slowed down and asked me if I needed a ride. The 28 miles on 87 flew by.</p>
<p>The very last leg of today&rsquo;s route was apparently on a dump truck circuit, because a group of maybe ten kept passing me in both directions, carrying dirt and gravel to one place and returning to another for more. They were not as friendly, often honking for me to completely get off the road and let them pass.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m in Wilmington, so close to the Atlantic and the state line. I&rsquo;m taking a rest day here tomorrow to recover &mdash; I hate to admit it, but I&rsquo;ve settled into muscle memory on my dominant leg. While I&rsquo;m passable on my other leg, it requires me thinking about how I&rsquo;m moving, and when I&rsquo;m also listening for traffic or looking for a turn, I don&rsquo;t like to be thinking about where to move my foot. So I&rsquo;ll probably use one leg for kicking the rest of the way, now that those muscles are being conditioned and specialized, and come back asymmetrically proportioned. Apologies in advance to anyone who&rsquo;ll have to be seen with me.</p>

<title>Day 6: Fayetteville - Elizabethtown</title>

<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day6.jpg" alt="Abandoned gas station" class="center">
<p class="caption">This abandoned gas station was at the intersection of Turnbull and Squatting Bear Drive. No joke!</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s entry is dedicated to everyone involved with the most recent paving of NC 242. What an awful stretch of garbage.</p>
<p>I thought tacking on an extra 5 miles yesterday would help me get similarly farther today, but no luck. The ranger at Singletary Lake State Park (maybe 10 more miles down the road) told me over the phone that their grounds are for group camping only and suggested I try Jones Lake State Park (now 2 miles behind me). My original plans had me blowing through 63 miles tomorrow to get to Wilmington, but I doubt that&rsquo;ll happen, especially if it&rsquo;s anything like the second half of today. I&rsquo;d likely have to set up camp next to a church along the way.</p>
<p>This morning involved 14.8 miles along the same road (Turnbull). The road was smooth and the wind was low so it went fairly easily. I stopped to eat at the intersection of Turnbull and 242. Good thing I did because I needed that boost to get through it. 242 required less distance than Turnbull but definitely more time. The road was super gritty, with decent-sized pebbles embedded in the asphalt. Like, hide-a-key rock sized. The only way to make it manageable was to skate in the traffic lane, over the general area where the tires of cars and trucks before me had gone, smoothing it out the tiniest bit.</p>
<p>Of course, this meant a lot of weaving back to the shoulder to let traffic by. And there were a bunch of semi trucks hauling livestock today. The worst was when they came at me and zoomed by, because the huge draft following them was not only strong enough to zap all my momentum, it smelled like a mountain of old poop.</p>
<p>Instead of making camp at Jones Lake, I decided to venture into Elizabethtown to get water and other supplies. It looked close enough on the map, but I didn&rsquo;t have the satellite view on, which would have shown the giant highway bridge I&rsquo;d have to cross. Clevelanders, think the Valley View bridge but thankfully about half as long and not quite as high. I went over that thing once, with semis rumbling next to me, and I&rsquo;m not going to do it again! Time to plan a new route into Wilmington.</p>

<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=35.111445&lon=-78.802317&zoom=10.86">46.4 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day5.jpg" alt="Gravel trail, asphalt trail" class="center">
<p class="caption">The two extremes of pavement experienced today. Impossible gravel on the left, beautiful smooth asphalt on the right.</p>
<p>It got into the 40s last night and stayed there into the morning, so I set out at 8:45 instead of 8 to let the temperature rise a little. And then promptly got lost looking for the first &ldquo;trail,&rdquo; which was actually the gravel bed of an old railroad track. After three u-turns, I found it and walked the 4.5 miles to start. It was surprisingly nice: not too cold, very quiet, and not strenuous in the least.</p>
<p>Then came the arduous skating on nice-to-okay roads for about 30 miles, including some serious uphills. Traffic was come and go, but decidedly less once the football games started at 1. I&rsquo;ve taken to calling long, easy downhills &ldquo;free miles&rdquo; in my otherwise empty head, since I don&rsquo;t have to do anything to earn them. Today, those didn&rsquo;t come until I got to Fort Bragg. Freedom isn&rsquo;t free, or something like that.</p>
<p>Shortly after Fort Bragg, I stopped at a Food Lion for more supplies, and ate some of them right away for lunch. While still preparing for the trip, my friend Joe told me that being hungry can really affect your mood, making you think you&rsquo;re physically tired before you are. He was so right. After that food kicked in, I had a second wind and breezed through the next leg (including the Cape Fear Trail &mdash; &ldquo;No skateboards allowed!&rdquo;) into downtown Fayetteville.</p>
<p>With that second wind in me, I decided to cut a few miles into tomorrow&rsquo;s route while it was still light out. Sorry Fayetteville, I&rsquo;ll hang out some other time. I&rsquo;ve driven to you and back in a day, so you&rsquo;re really not that far (sigh).</p>
<p>One guy came out of a bar to complement my board. A couple blocks later, another guy did the same, and then some. He introduced himself as Greg, homeless and roaming the country. But he was pretty clean-cut and had a light pack. He asked if he could walk with me for a while, and (1) being an idiot (2) thinking he meant the couple blocks of downtown, I said yes. When we reached the end, Greg said not to go any farther because it was a bad part of town. I said I had the fire in me and was going to keep going. Greg launched into a routine I&rsquo;ve heard a dozen times and asked for money for a bus ticket. I said no. He asked for money for his own skateboard. I said that sounded like a lot more money, so no. I gave him two granola bars and sped outta there. Nothing like the (maybe misguided) fear of a stranger to bring on that third wind.</p>

<title>Day 4: Clayton - Dunn</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=35.474908&lon=-78.431251&zoom=10.9">40 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day4.jpg" alt="Water Tower" class="center">
<p>What goes up must come down, except for the roads in Four Oaks, NC. Those only go up.</p>
<p>I ended up walking a lot of today, maybe a third of the distance. Right at the start, I was facing an uphill on the shoulder of US 70 Business, staring into the morning sun. Fortunately, I could cut through the strip mall parking lots that ran along the side, and walk on the shoulder when they ended.</p>
<p>I had to walk the forever-long Booker Dairy bridge over the Neuse river (again) because its pavement was grooved. It was another reminder that this route is meant for cyclists, whose wheels are big enough that grooves don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And the final 15 miles or so were into gale-force headwinds. Anything less than a moderate downhill was a waste of energy to skate. In these situations, cyclists can drop to a lower gear to conserve energy, and to me that means walking. I don&rsquo;t mind it though, it feels like a rest for my knees and calves.</p>
<p>Almost all of today&rsquo;s route was on roads. The only bike trail began as a loop around a middle school&rsquo;s athletic fields, and I came up on two middle schoolers putting the green in greenway, if you know what I mean. One of them gave me a thumbs up. Still got it!</p>
<p>I thought country roads would be easy and safe because no one takes them. In reality, they&rsquo;re dangerous because no one takes them. The few cars and trucks that do, fly through them. Every day on this trip brings a new scary thing, and today&rsquo;s was a big pickup truck doing 60&ndash;70 a few feet to the left.</p>
<p>Around 1:45pm with 10 or so miles to go, I stopped for lunch at Kelly&rsquo;s &mdash; the definition of &ldquo;hole in the wall&rdquo; &mdash; in Benson. And I&rsquo;m glad I did. Mr. Kelly himself was tending bar, and there was one customer nursing a can of Coke when I walked in. I asked if the kitchen was still open and Mr. Kelly replied, &ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t opened yet. I don&rsquo;t turn anything on until my first order. Electricity is expensive.&rdquo; The quickest thing he said he could turn out was a pizza, so that&rsquo;s what I ordered. I listened to him talk to his customer and a second one that walked in as it cooked. You get the impression that only friends of Mr. Kelly stop in at his bar. He brought the pizza out, watched me eat a slice, and asked how it was. &ldquo;Usually I heat up a Tombstone but they jacked up the price of those at Wal-Mart, so that one there&rsquo;s a Red Baron.&rdquo; Gourmet.</p>
<p>Somewhere before my final stop, I hit 100 miles total! And I finally got out of the 919. It&rsquo;s really happening now.</p>

<title>Day 3: Raleigh - Clayton</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/day3.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=35.721736&lon=-78.546812&zoom=12.12">27.3 miles</a></h2>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day3.jpg" alt="Neuse River Bridge" class="center">
<p>It felt really good to get back on the trail this morning. My neck and back were only slightly uncomfortable after the morning painkiller kicked in. Too bad downtown Raleigh was where my first of only two planned course deviations were, so I made three wrong turns early in the morning, following the official ECG route instead of taking a shortcut.</p>
<p>But once things were on their way, it became a great day. The highlight was the Neuse River Trail, which ran next to rolling farmland for many miles, separated by a picturesque white fence. It also meandered back and forth over its namesake river, one such time with the bridge in the top photo.</p>
<p>I kept on my hospital wristband to remind me to take downhills slower today. While they now frighten me a little more, my new public enemy #1 is headwinds. Combined with an uphill, they sap all energy.</p>
<p>Lots of dogs decided to bark at me today. Six would&rsquo;ve chased me but were thankfully behind a fence. One was pooping on the side of the trail and didn&rsquo;t hear me coming. My sudden approach terrified him; he stopped mid-pinch and ran away.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s route was itself the second half of my initial first day route, and all the exciting things happened in the second half of today. I guided two EMTs to a cyclist that had fallen and landed on his head, shattering his helmet and maybe breaking some ribs. He was battered but going to be okay. Are these omens?</p>
<p>Part of the trail was closed for (de)construction of a bridge. All traffic had to make a hasty detour around big cranes and trucks. I met a nice couple going for their midday bike ride on the Sam&rsquo;s Branch trail near Clayton. After explaining my trip, the woman compared me to Forrest Gump &mdash; high praise!</p>
<p>The final two miles of this route were on the slim shoulder of a steep, uphill, 45mph road. I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking putting that at the end of a long first day. My back and neck feel much better but probably not ready for a tent night on the ground, so I walked into another hotel at 2pm. Here&rsquo;s to a full night of rest, and getting through a full day of skateboarding tomorrow!</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day2.jpg" alt="Bump on the head" class="center">
<p>At my parents&rsquo; behest (and really, common sense), Sara accompanied me to Wake Med&rsquo;s trauma center last night. They took x-rays to make sure no bones were broken, and ultimately declared I had a contusion to my thoracic spine. I got an awesome muscle relaxer that must have kicked in after I fell asleep. And then I slept for most of the day.</p>
<p>I feel much better than yesterday but still not 100%. With tonight&rsquo;s rest and a continued ibuprofen regimen, I&rsquo;m confident I can finish my original day one route tomorrow, ending up only two days behind. Let me say again, everyone needs to wear helmets! I don&rsquo;t want to think about what would&rsquo;ve happened if I hadn&rsquo;t. Even with the helmet, I got a nice red mark on my forehead at the point of impact (the photo at the top).</p>
<p>Back to sleep, and back at it tomorrow!</p>

<title>Day 1: Durham - Raleigh</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/day1.html</link>
<category>Board Trip</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2><a href="https://felt.com/map/Board-Trips-6o1gBKJaQPiVTTnDRStIgA?lat=35.861761&lon=-78.818882&zoom=12.16">37.4 miles</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/boardtrip/photos/day1.jpg" alt="East Coast Greenway Sign" class="left">This trip is a while in the making. It was something that sprung essentially fully-formed into mind when I was living in Florida, in a transitional period of my life. I read about people going east to west along major US freeways and thought I could do that too. But then a better (safer) option presented itself and I moved to North Carolina. Fast forward two and a half years, and I&rsquo;ve created another transitional period for myself. To be more cautious, this time I&rsquo;ve planned to stay on dedicated bike paths as often as possible, and go only a third of the original cross-country distance: from Durham, NC to Jupiter, FL.</p>
<p>Why do it at all? Many people have asked if I&rsquo;m doing it for a certain cause. Others have drawn the comparison to the running scene from Forrest Gump &mdash; &ldquo;I just felt like running!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s definitely the latter for me. And maybe there&rsquo;s a link there; Forrest Gump is not only my favorite movie, but for like four hours total today, the 30 seconds of &ldquo;Hooked on a Feeling&rdquo; from SNL&rsquo;s parody of Guardians of the Galaxy were looping in my otherwise empty head. Stupid is as stupid does, I guess. But I shouldn&rsquo;t get ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The East Coast Greenway piggybacks on the American Tobacco Trail in Durham, so I started there this morning, just north of the recently-completed ATT bridge over I-40. Almost immediately there were two steep downhills in quick succession behind the Southpoint mall, in which I was worried about falling (unfortunate foreshadowing!). Then the ATT smoothed out for about eight miles of the ten I was scheduled to take. The final two were not paved, but a cement/mud mixture that was juuuuuuust liquid enough to make skateboarding impossible. So I started walking, a mere hour into the journey. And walking for two miles is demoralizing above all else! Morning joggers were lapping me.</p>
<p>When I finally reached another paved road, it was smooth asphalt and just the right amount of downhill. After a half hour or so of dejected trudging (and Hooked on a Feeling), I was able to go right into that scene from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, when Ben Stiller goes all out on his longboard, carving back and forth on an empty picturesque street. At that moment, everything was perfect.</p>
<p>The next 2+ hours were routine skating on bike paths: paved, unthreatening, a mix of uphill and downhill. I began forming lists of likes and dislikes in my head, but they only went so far:<br>
&bull; Likes: moderate downhills<br>
&bull; Dislikes: anything uphill<br>
&bull; Not sure: flat ground, steep downhills<br>
I had a couple of great moderate downhills in this stretch, where I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about kicking nor the possibility of someone appearing too quickly for me to react. In fact, I had three such lovely downhills interrupted (and made notes of each one): an old lady weaving and covering the whole path, a family with two unpredictable kids on plastic bikes, and having to cross the dumb street.</p>
<p>Then I crossed I-40 again and entered Umstead Park. More loose cement-y gravel in the place of paved road, kind of uphill, for 4&ndash;5 miles. So I walked, and it felt like it took forever. But HoaF kept playing and I didn&rsquo;t get too down. I excitedly got back on the board once I left the park, but it was a moderate uphill that tired me out more than I expected. Once I got a few miles further to the NC museum of art, I thought everything would get better.</p>
<p>I had a little snack and some water, and started on the blue loop trail around the museum park. Some good downhills, some dumb uphills, and some steep downhills. On the second quick downhill, a biker came out from around a turn in my lane. He was chugging hard to make it up the hill and was kind of weaving. I was going too fast to react well, so I swerved to avoid hitting him, bailed off the board, and landed right on the asphalt with my head. EVERYONE WEAR HELMETS! I&rsquo;m not paralyzed or even hurt that badly, but I tweaked (twerked?) something in my neck, and got small boo boos on my right elbow and knee. That guy kept going too, I don&rsquo;t think he heard me wipe out.</p>
<p>Every so often today, I skated by an intersection or building that I&rsquo;d driven by since moving here. I anticipated that, and had planned on going well past my daily 40 mile goal today (powered by the adrenaline of the first day) so I wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep in essentially the same metropolitan area I always do. But since my neck doesn&rsquo;t feel so great, I halfheartedly skated and walked from the museum through Meredith College and NCSU to a hotel in downtown Raleigh where I&rsquo;m staying tonight.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t feel 100% when I wake up, that just means my first rest day comes early! My spirits remain high; I&rsquo;m thankful nothing worse happened, thankful for helmets, and most of all embarrassed that this simple fool who entertains himself with iTunes music samples managed to hurt himself on day one of at least twenty five.</p>

<title>I am a Idiot</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/i-am-a-idiot.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I recently watched someone evaluate potential hires based on online information for the first time. Each full name search led to LinkedIn pages, Instagram profiles, personal blogs, portfolios, and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Some candidates were eliminated because they lacked experience, but others because they didn&rsquo;t make a good impression. The man whose blog referenced his military experience and Semper Fi philosophy was out. The 20-something whose Instagram photos showed him tanning on cruise ships was out. And I knew that if I was up for the position I&rsquo;d be out too.</p>
<p>My LinkedIn profile should <em>(should)</em> no longer exist, so the top search result for my name is either this domain or my Twitter account. The former demonstrates little competitive value in my ability to program or design web pages, and the latter paints me as an <a href="https://twitter.com/bsuto/status/209998437901541378">immature simpleton who eats junk food all the time</a>. An idiot. But this is a conscious choice, a deliberate effort, to convey a stylized version of myself. It&rsquo;s a character I play, online.<sup><a href="#fn-1-ii" id="fr-1-ii">1</a></sup> This character isn&rsquo;t as dumb as other online archetypal idiots: he usually spells correctly, avoids abbreviations, and never curses. You&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking he&rsquo;s the real me. But he&rsquo;s an idiot, and no one wants to hire an idiot.</p>
<p><em>Quick Wikipedia tangent: </em>without having taken any psychology classes nor knowing what the <strong>id</strong> was, I assumed <strong>idiot</strong> would have been derived from it. But while the id turns out to be &ldquo;the unorganized part of the personality structure that contains a human's basic, instinctual drives,&rdquo; idiot actually comes from the Latin <strong>idiota</strong> meaning ordinary person or layman. Occam&rsquo;s razor, I guess. And I never mean to use the word idiot as any kind of derogatory descriptor of the intellectually disabled. But if &ldquo;idiotic&rdquo; has the same stigma as the r-word, that&rsquo;s genuine ignorance on my part and I&rsquo;ll stop using it so carelessly.<sup><a href="#fn-2-ii" id="fr-2-ii">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of ignorance, there&rsquo;s a distinction between being a lovable, funny idiot and an offensive one. And I think the difference is na&iuml;vet&eacute; versus ignorance. The na&iuml;ve guy is an idiot because he doesn&rsquo;t know better, the ignorant guy is an idiot because he does.</p>
<p>No one wants to hire <a href="https://twitter.com/bsuto/status/408748405075103744">this idiot</a>! So why act like one? Well, it&rsquo;s a habit I&rsquo;ve had longer than my Twitter account. It&rsquo;s a way of managing expectations, setting the bar low, giving into laziness and a lack of self-confidence. But it&rsquo;s also a way to protect against that lack of self-confidence: you make a joke about yourself before anybody else and you control whatever about you is subject to ridicule. Intellect was my primary identifying characteristic growing up. I wasn&rsquo;t popular or athletic, I did well on math homework. So I reinforced that by joking about being dumb when it wasn&rsquo;t outright detrimental.</p>
<p>One of Del Close&rsquo;s rules for improvising comedy is to &ldquo;play at the top of your intelligence.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s you the performer, not you the character. And I guess that&rsquo;s why me-on-Twitter still attempts to use complete sentences and correct spelling. If a future potential employer doesn&rsquo;t see past the surface,<sup><a href="#fn-3-ii" id="fr-3-ii">3</a></sup> maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t work well with them anyway. I want to work with the people who like both sides of the character; the one behind the scenes at the top of his intelligence and the one at the forefront operating way below it. After all, isn&rsquo;t that one of the reasons we loved Calvin and Hobbes? <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/21">This kid</a> and <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27">this kid</a> were the same person.</p>
<ol class="footnotes">
<li id="fn-1-ii">Really, it comes down to writing any dumb thing I think <a href="https://twitter.com/bsuto/status/229356075122581505">or do</a> that also has a chance of being funny. Real-life me censors when the dumb outweighs the funny. <a href="#fr-1-ii">↩︎︎</a></li>
<li id="fn-2-ii">And take this post down, or remove the links to it, or something. <a href="#fr-2-ii">↩︎︎</a></li>
<li id="fn-3-ii">Or read this pretentious garbage nullifying the whole thing <a href="#fr-3-ii">↩︎︎</a></li>

<title>Ten Years of iTunes</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/ten-years-of-itunes.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>On August 5th, 2003, I prepared my new laptop to take to college, importing all my MP3s from the family computer into iTunes. Ten years later, I no longer have that laptop, but I&rsquo;ve transferred my iTunes library from computer to computer in such a way that the play counts and dates added never reset. So now I have ten solid years of iTunes usage data.</p>
<p>I got all the data into a spreadsheet by enabling all the necessary columns in iTunes&rsquo; &ldquo;Songs&rdquo; view, selecting all, and copying and pasting. The track length times had to be converted from &ldquo;time of day&rdquo; to actual time lengths but otherwise everything was that easy. A few caveats: it&rsquo;s unclear how much play count data is imported from iPods and iPhones (to say nothing of listening I did on work computers), there were a few times iTunes was left running without me listening, and I clearly have immature taste in music.</p>

<title>I'm Fortunate</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/fortunate.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to have been born in the United States, and an affluent area of the country at that. I&rsquo;m fortunate that I&rsquo;ve never suffered or had unmet needs. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have been born to two parents who are very much in love with each other, after more than thirty years, and have defined such an aspirational model of love for me. I&rsquo;m fortunate that these parents wanted and worked for the best for me; making sure I ate well, played sports, studied, learned an instrument, and got otherwise involved with the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to count dozens of wonderful people among my friends and family. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have these people in my life, despite any physical and/or emotional distance I put between them and myself. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have three little brothers who couldn&rsquo;t be more different in some ways and more alike in others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate that my body, with minimum upkeep and occasional abuse, is remarkably healthy. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have been born with all my senses, limbs, and functions in perfect working order. I&rsquo;m so fortunate to have never depended on glasses, or an inhaler, or regular medication or treatments of any kind. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have avoided broken bones and serious injuries or illnesses, let alone unpredictable catastrophes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate that things <em>worked out</em>. I&rsquo;m fortunate that the people I met in Shaker Heights chose to live there and the people I met at the Claremont Colleges chose to go there, because I am a better version of myself for having known them. I&rsquo;m fortunate that Facebook Inc. chose my resume when I sent it in cold, and I&rsquo;m fortunate that my grandmother lived a mile from their headquarters and was happy to take me in. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time for that industry, fortunate that the career path I fell into at that company groomed me for a higher position at another, and fortunate that Twitter Inc. was considering such a position at the same time that I was. I&rsquo;m fortunate that these companies have continued their success in such a way that I can fall back on equity earned there if I need to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate that my grandfather had a vacant home I could escape to when I needed to &ldquo;figure myself out.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m fortunate that an old friend chose to reconnect with me when my figuring-out phase was going nowhere. I&rsquo;m fortunate that it was unbelievably easy to move my life on a whim, both emotionally and physically, for me and the people close to me. I&rsquo;m fortunate that the new-life gamble paid out immensely–fortunate that the small town I moved to has a really good comedy theatre that has given me the opportunity to explore something I always wanted to, fortunate that a local startup dedicated to finding work for college students let me in despite my age, fortunate that early work secured through that startup turned into a dependable and rewarding job.</p>
<p>I say I&rsquo;m fortunate because not all of these things were direct results of something I did. I wrote this to remind me of my incredible situation in life, should I ever doubt it. And I published it to hold myself publicly accountable, in case you ever catch me forgetting <em>how good</em> I have it.</p>

<title>The Weight of Light</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/weight-of-light.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Although both weight and light end in the same four letters, the two words do not rhyme and are rarely seen together as a result. Using basic physics and common household objects, however, it is easy to determine the weight of light.</p>
<p>Light is a collection of waves, much like the ocean. Varying colors are produced when a substance absorbs some of the energy in light waves and reflects the rest. Red colors have the longest wavelengths, and they get shorter as one progresses down the rainbow to violet. Therefore, a substance that appears red is absorbing all sizes of visible light wavelengths except the longest, and reflecting those long red wavelengths back to the viewer. Substances that absorb <em>all</em> visible light wavelengths appear black, and reflexively substances that reflect all visible light wavelengths appear white.</p>
<p>With this in mind, consider a black scale. When a light is shone on such a measuring device, it is absorbing all wavelengths of that light&rsquo;s visible spectrum and thus bearing that additional weight. A white scale, on the other hand, is reflecting all wavelengths. This fact is often overlooked, and can skew results if a dark scale color is not factored into its initial calibration.</p>
<h2>Theoretical Result</h2>
<p>The energy of light (in joules) is a function of the bulb&rsquo;s wattage and the amount of time that the light is turned on. In the real-world trials described in the following section, both of these factors are constants, so energy is calculated as such using these values. The energy figure is then interpreted as kinetic energy, which is a function of mass and velocity. Velocity in this case is the speed of light, which is a known constant. It is then easy to solve for the mass of light.</p>
<p class="scientific">E<sub>J</sub> = P<sub>w</sub> <span class="shrink">&#10005;</span> t<sub>s</sub></p>
<p class="scientific">P<sub>w</sub> = 60W ; t<sub>s</sub> = 10s</p>
<p class="scientific">E<sub>J</sub> = 600J</p>
<p class="scientific">E<sub>k</sub> = &#189; m <span class="shrink">&#10005;</span> v<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="scientific">v = 3<span class="shrink">&#10005;</span>10<sup>8</sup>m/s</p>
<p class="scientific">E<sub>k</sub> = E<sub>J</sub> = 600J</p>
<p class="scientific">m = (600J / (3<span class="shrink">&#10005;</span>10<sup>8</sup>m/s)<sup>2</sup>) <span class="shrink">&#10005;</span> 2</p>
<p class="scientific">m = 1.3&#773;<span class="shrink">&#10005;</span>10<sup>-14</sup>kg</p>
<p>Therefore, the amount of light cast by a 60W bulb for 10 seconds weighs approximately <strong>0.00000000000003 pounds</strong>.</p>
<h2>Empirical Result</h2>
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/scale.jpg" alt="Light on Scale" class="right">For the first trial, paint the weighing platform of a <a href="https://balance.balances.com/scales/854">Sartorius CPA225D</a><sup><a href="#fn-1-wl" id="fr-1-wl">1</a></sup> analytical scale with 0.01mg of white paint and calibrate it properly. Situate a desk lamp with a 60W incandescent bulb half a meter from the scale, and shine the lamp on the scale for exactly ten seconds. Record the weight reading at the end of the tenth second. For the second trial, paint the weighing platform with 0.01mg of black paint and repeat, recording the weight reading again at the end of the tenth second.</p>
<p>Thanks to the second-to-none precision of the Sartorius CPA225D,<sup><a href="#fn-2-wl" id="fr-2-wl">2</a></sup> the varying weight readouts can be recorded down to the hundredth of a milligram. When these trials were run by the author, the painted-white scale read 0 mg and the painted black scale read 0.01 mg. In imperial units, that&rsquo;s approximately <strong>0.00000002 pounds</strong>. This is 99.999%<sup><a href="#fn-3-wl" id="fr-3-wl">3</a></sup> higher than the theoretical value, showing the true risk of failing to calibrate scales to account for the weight of light.</p>

<title>Replacing Salt &amp; Fat</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/replacing-salt-and-fat.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Humans have evolved base-level instincts to ensure salt and fat are components of our daily diet, despite the risks involved with both. Reasons for these basal desires are explored and a dietary supplement that satisfies them, without any of the negative effects of high-salt and high-fat diets, is constructed.</p>
<h2>Diet and Taste</h2>
<h3>Salt</h3>
<p>Subscribers to the theory of evolution hold as a truth that monkeys lie directly up the evolutionary tree from humans. If we look further, we discover that humans actually came from fish-like creatures in the primordial soup of early Earth. Then, and today, the salinity level in the oceans was high enough that it must be processed when ingested.
Therefore, the oldest components of our genetic material are programmed for a dependency on seawater. As is commonly known, over half of the human body is made up of water, but it is becoming increasingly less salty as we continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Sodium, the <em>s</em> in salt, is an essential nutrient for human function. Its duties include regulating blood pressure through the salinity levels in blood and facilitating activity in the nervous system. In abnormally high levels, sodium can overpower the filtering mechanisms in kidneys and lead to high blood pressure. If the kidneys are already weakened, for example by a swift punch, the risk is even higher.</p>
<h3>Fat</h3>
<p>Fat is animal tissue that is too weak to perform motor actions. This is why exercise develops muscle in any species, while lack of exercise results in a fat individual. There are many kinds of fats, though. Saturated fats and trans fats have known links to high cholesterol and increased propensity for heart failure. Omega-3<sup><a href="#fn-1-sf" id="fr-1-sf">1</a></sup> fatty acids, on the other hand, reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular disease, and contribute to overall mental and physical well-being.</p>
<p>Residents of any city with a farmer&rsquo;s market are familiar with the practice of swallowing fish oil in pill or liquid form to supplement the diet with Omega-3 fats. Fish are the most common source of Omega-3 fatty acids for humans, but not everyone gets down with bait and tackle, hence these supplements.</p>
<p>The risks of a high-fat diet are well known, regardless of the particular fat&rsquo;s intentions. Ridicule by peers, in a way that has fallen out of fashion for race and sexual orientation, is still a very harsh reality for those whose fat intake is abnormally high. Excessive fat intake also leads to weight gain: analogous to the popular riddle &ldquo;Which weighs more, a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn-2-sf" id="fr-2-sf">2</a></sup> is &ldquo;Which weighs more, a pound of fat or a pound of muscle?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn-3-sf" id="fr-3-sf">3</a></sup></p>
<h2>Instinct and Reward</h2>
<h3>Taste Zones</h3>
<p>The human tongue is covered in taste buds segregated into six distinct districts, as oh-so-accurately taught in 20th-century elementary schools. Two of these taste zones are dedicated to sensing salty quantities in foods, due to its importance. Sweetness is relegated to just the tip of the tongue; and bitterness, which no one would prefer to taste anyway, is way at the back. The other two districts are dedicated to sensing sour tastes, and there is a recently discovered fifth taste type, umami, as well.</p>
<p>Like all things Japanese, umami is difficult to explain, but it is analogous to savory tastes like a fatty pot pie. Umami does not have a dedicated taste zone on the tongue, but research by Adam Fleischman [2] suggests that umami overpowers sour, as shown by the lack of lemons in his products. As a result, especially in American diets, the two sour taste zones have converted to umami taste zones, and overall the tongue becomes especially programmed to detect salty and savory (fatty) tastes in food.</p>
<h3>Dopamine Levels</h3>
<p>Dopamine is a chemical used to deliver signals between neurons in the brain. As they say, good news travels fast, and signals of pleasure are the most popular forms of dopamine releases. Hard drugs like cocaine have direct effects on dopamine reception, which is why they make you feel so great.</p>
<p>Dopamine levels increase in kind with moderate (not life-threatening) increases in salt intake, but not in temporary spikes. A drop in Omega-3 intake has been shown to cause a similar drop in dopamine. Salt is an adrenal stimulant, releasing adrenal hormones as it&rsquo;s ingested, creating a reaction similar to those seen in drug addicts. Therefore, when both salt and fat are not present in normal quantities, the body enters a depression-like state.</p>
<h2>Building the Product</h2>
<h3>Emulating Salt</h3>
<p>With no shortage of artificial, synthesized sweeteners [4], emulating the sweet taste without incurring the dietary risks of sugar has become commonplace. Emulating salt is more difficult, since half of salt is chlorine which is poisonous in large amounts. Existing mass-market solutions replace the sodium in salt with potassium, but neon was chosen in this case as it also obviates the need for artificial coloring.</p>
<p>Super-cooling neon gas brings it to a workable form, which is then mixed with elemental sodium, heated into a stew, and put into ice cube trays. Once super-cooled again, the solution is ground into a glowing red powder.</p>
<h3>Overloading Umami</h3>
<p>Ordinarily, the umami flavor response is triggered by the presence of glutamic acids, like Monosodium Glutamate (MSG). It is also triggered by mushrooms<sup><a href="#fn-4-sf" id="fr-4-sf">4</a></sup>, especially once saut&eacute;ed to emulate the experience of tasting fat. Caution must be taken to avoid saut&eacute;ing mushrooms in a fatty substrate like butter, so carefully-selected button mushrooms are saut&eacute;ed in Olestra, then minced into workable sizes for inclusion in the product.</p>
<h3>Alternate Pleasure Sources</h3>
<p>Chocolate is well-known for increasing dopamine levels in romantic comedies and tabloid magazines. Without adding sugar, milk, or dark, it can still produce the effect without any negative externalities. Hershey&rsquo;s cocoa powder is mixed into the product to ensure high dopamine levels and provide a pleasant dessert-y flavor.</p>
<h3>Blood Pressure Regulation</h3>
<p>The active ingredient in Bayer is aspirin. Moving on.</p>
<h3>Osmoregulation</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, the sodium in salt helps regulate the homeostasis of fluids in the body, which in turn keeps blood pressure at healthy levels. Building off of research by Wayne Szalinski [1] and Vector Scope [3], full pump stations which autonomously regulate a host&rsquo;s blood pressure are procured and then superminiaturized. It takes some creativity, but these microscopic pump stations can successfully be added into the product and configured to come online when they detect the presence of stomach acid. Ingeniously, the only waste byproduct of these stations is white blood cells.</p>
<h3>Neural Strength</h3>
<p>Anyone can walk up to the counter at a truck stop and pick from dozens of mental stimulants and other nootropics. After performing this experiment in multiple controlled environments<sup><a href="#fn-5-sf" id="fr-5-sf">5</a></sup>, finely ground Gingko biloba emerged as the most popular and was added to the final product.</p>
<h2>Product Availability</h2>
<h3>Animal Testing</h3>
<p>Each dose of the product was limited to 400mg. The major active ingredients are saut&eacute;ed mushrooms and cocoa powder. Inactive ingredients include sodium neon, aspirin, Gingko biloba, miniaturized pump stations (aluminum, kerosene), and gelatin (binding agent).</p>
<p>Initial tests were performed on common farm pigs. After one week at two doses per day, the test subjects were less interested in their trough-slop than the control pigs. Both groups performed similarly in blood pressure tests, and the pigs using the product actually scored higher on the PSAT following the conclusion of the test.<sup><a href="#fn-6-sf" id="fr-6-sf">6</a></sup></p>
<h3>Retail Placement</h3>
<p>Bolstered by the positive results and a generous offer from Pfizer, commercial versions of this product will appear in drug store chains in late 2012. No prescription will be necessary and a month&rsquo;s supply will retail at $3,000. When one considers the amount of meals purchased at fast-food locations, snacks purchased from vending machines, or other sources of high-salt and high-fat food that will no longer be desired, this is entirely reasonable.</p>
<h3>Side Effects</h3>
<p>Prolonged use of this product at its recommended dosage may, but not necessarily will, cause one or more of the following: genius, modification of eye color, improved mile time, death, odorless flatulence, immunity to osteoporosis, and skin tags.</p>

<h3>Pageviews Deep Dive</h3>
<p>Pageviews are an increasingly less-relevant metric for many reasons. The launch of version 1.1 in Q1 moved the initial software loading to AJAX calls, decreasing the amount of pageviews per card session. Interest around the new version actually caused pageviews to spike after the launch, even with the new architecture. They then continued to drop for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Apple released iOS 5.0 in Q4, which broke Pastecard&rsquo;s offline functionality on iPhones and iPod touches. Tests for the fix were run on the live site, which caused a brief spike in pageviews during this period.</p>
<p>The Twitter game &ldquo;Where in the Tworld?&rdquo; was hosted on Pastecard&rsquo;s servers from Q1 through Q3. Removing the game files in Q4 had a visible negative effect on systemwide pageviews despite no one seeming to play it.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em> there was no real traffic to the site in Q4 2011, judging by pageview metrics.</p>
<h2>2011 Financials</h2>
<h3>Operating Expenses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Domain Registrations: <strong>$10</strong></li>
<li>Disk Space and Bandwidth: <strong>$25</strong></li>
<li>Employee Compensation Packages: <strong>$0</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Revenues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Advertising: <strong>$0</strong></li>
<li>Venture Capital Financing: <strong>$0</strong></li>
<li>Customer Payments: <strong>$0</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Profits</h3>
<ul><li><span class="bad">-$35</span></li></ul>
<h2>2012 Forecast</h2>
<h3>Growth</h3>
<p>The company aims to maintain a 40% growth rate in user registrations. To accomplish this, the onboarding experience will be rewritten with more AJAX calls and simpler human language.</p>
<p>We are also working to continue driving down the average time spent on the site. Currently, over 75% of visits are under two minutes. We think we can get this cohort uninterested and off the site in under 60 seconds by the end of 2012.</p>
<h3>Profitability</h3>
<p>Operating Expenses are expected to remain the same, and have been cleverly spaced out with bandwidth billing in Q1 and domain billing in Q3 to avoid bankruptcy. The Board has recommended adding a marketing department to promote the company, which will add a new line item to our costs.</p>
<h4>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL</h4>
<p>2011&rsquo;s big product launch was version 1.1, a complete loading architecture rewrite and the introduction of offline capabilities in iPhones and iPod touches. 2012&rsquo;s product initiative is physical Pastecards: blank business cards bought at Office Depot and resold at a significant markup. A successful launch will bring the company into profitability for the first time, and we anticipate a strong Q4 due to holiday shopping.</p>

<title>The GQ Interview&#58; 26-year-old Brian Sutorius, as 16-year-old Brian Sutorius dreamed he would be</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/gq-interview.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p><strong>GQ: Thanks for having me over, and congratulations on the movie. Still number one at the box office.</strong></p>
<p>BS: Well thank you. Can I get you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>GQ: I probably shouldn&rsquo;t.</strong></p>
<p>BS: It&rsquo;s just as well. I only have Gatorade and Dr. Pepper.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You designed this house, right? What was your inspiration?</strong></p>
<p>BS: I looked at a lot of my friends&rsquo; studio apartments and kind of went from there. It&rsquo;s a pretty small space for a house, just the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, and the garage. But I park outside, so the garage can also be the living room when I have guests over.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: That&rsquo;s the room we&rsquo;re in now, isn&rsquo;t it?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You&rsquo;re telling me you built a glorified studio apartment on this huge piece of Beverly Hills land?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Sure, why not? Less to clean, and I have a lot of room to play sports outside whenever I want.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: What do you play?</strong></p>
<p>BS: How about we go inside.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>GQ: I can honestly say that I didn&rsquo;t expect your closet to just be racks and racks of sports shorts on hangers. You must have a pair of basketball shorts in every team&rsquo;s colors, pro and college.</strong></p>
<p>BS: This is pretty much what my dresser has looked like since I was in high school. The only difference is now I have more of them.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You dress like you&rsquo;re going to the gym everyday?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Absolutely. You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p><strong>GQ: That can&rsquo;t be true. I saw a picture of you dressed up at an event recently.</strong></p>
<p>BS: Well yeah, I appreciate that there are of course times when it&rsquo;s good to look good. That&rsquo;s why I have a suit in the back of my car.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: Is that your car in the driveway? A mailman truck?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Got that at a Post Office auction! It doesn&rsquo;t do too well on the highways.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: What about celebrity opulence? Do you travel or go out a lot?</strong></p>
<p>BS: The one extravagance I allowed myself was this custom Egg McMuffin machine. Any time of the day I can walk into my kitchen and press this little button. One button. ONE BUTTON! And three minutes later, an Egg McMuffin slides down this little chute. There&rsquo;s a whole closet of machinery in the next room making this happen. But all I have to do is go to Vons once a week and buy two dozen eggs, a block of cheddar, and a&hellip; a <em>tube</em> of Canadian bacon. Load them up in the special refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: What about English muffins?</strong></p>
<p>BS: Ok, that&rsquo;s a second celebrity luxury. I have them flown in every morning from England. [laughs] Naw, I go to Vons for those too. Sometimes I get the stale ones to save money. It&rsquo;s not like you taste a difference once they&rsquo;re toasted.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>GQ: You auditioned twice for Saturday Night Live but didn&rsquo;t make it.</strong></p>
<p>BS: Yeah, and there&rsquo;s no bad blood about that at all. It let me go on to do all this other great stuff. And I keep in touch with Lorne; if I&rsquo;m ever in a position to cast a live-action Mr. Peanut, I have his number.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: Okay, one more question. What&rsquo;s a secret you want to tell the ladies?</strong></p>
<p>BS: I lost my virginity to <em>Teenage Dream</em>.</p>
<p><strong>GQ: Didn&rsquo;t that song come out last year?</strong></p>
<p>BS: I thought you said that was the last question.</p>
<p><em>You can hear Brian as the voice of Huey in the DuckTales movie, now in theaters everywhere.</em></p>

<title>Airplane Mode</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/airplane-mode.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>My monthly cell phone bill is over $75, and I&rsquo;ve been paying it for over three years. That&rsquo;s enough time to get me out of the standard two-year contract, and I&rsquo;m thinking about closing my account. As I&rsquo;ve written before, my phone is not just a mobile device but an everything device. Does it lose that ability without a constant cellular connection?</p>
<p>I can test this by going into Airplane Mode, but leaving other antennas like WiFi and Location Services on. In some cases, I might need to buy a new app or service to cover the difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone: I can use FaceTime to &ldquo;call&rdquo; people with modern iOS or Mac devices, and just set the expectation that my video feed won&rsquo;t necessarily be trained on my face. I can also port my current number to a Google Voice account, then forward that to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/nyregion/30about.html">drug-dealer phone</a> for &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; calls. I used a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go phone exclusively for most of college and it wasn&rsquo;t bad at all.</li>
<li>Text messages: Again, I can rely on iMessage for people with modern iOS (and maybe Mac, in the future) devices. I can also use Twitter DMs.</li>
<li>Email, Twitter, RSS, web browsing: just wait until I&rsquo;m at home or on public WiFi.</li>
<li>Camera, music, games, books: shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</li>
<li>Maps: this is the tough case. I really only use this app when I&rsquo;m out of WiFi range and <em>need</em> a data connection. The most straightforward option sounds like paying ~$50 for a GPS app from a company like TomTom that includes map files with the app bundle. Not cheap, but relatively easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying a pay-as-you-go phone and GPS app will probably set me back as much as one month&rsquo;s bill. There&rsquo;s the ongoing cost of phone minutes, though, and while I would intend for that phone to just be used for emergencies, I can totally see my parents redefining &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; to include regular Sutorius family updates, and that could turn costly fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.republicwireless.com/">Republic Wireless</a> just launched their $19/month unlimited plan, which includes minutes, messages, and data. You have to use a specific Android phone, but if I was going to resign myself to a cheap dumbphone anyway, that&rsquo;s not a bad spot at all. Without the fear of any overages, I could use a Republic phone for emergency calls <em>and</em> map data on the go, for only a quarter of the cost of my current phone bill. They piggyback on Sprint&rsquo;s network, which isn&rsquo;t terrible either. Combined with Google Voice to set restrictions on which numbers would actually be forwarded to the phone, and the ability to keep my current number, I might just go all in with this option. I&rsquo;ll certainly report back if I do.</p>
<p>The one bummer about cancelling my AT&amp;T account is that I&rsquo;m grandfathered into some pretty great stuff. I still have the $30 unlimited data plan, the $10 for 1000 messages plan, and a 10% company discount for a company that I left two years ago. I definitely won&rsquo;t get any of these back if I give them up now.</p>

<title>The Most Important Video Games</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/most-important-video-games.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about the <em>best</em> or <em>most-cherished</em> video games, but rather the ones that are most important to the industry and the people who play. I don&rsquo;t even really count in that latter category, I&rsquo;m a noob. The following is just from the top of my head, with some quick Wikipedia research to make sure I didn&rsquo;t get any facts incorrect.</p>
<h2>Nominees</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Brothers">Super Mario Brothers</a>, NES, 1985. No explanation needed, I think.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, DOS, 1992. Unleashed the first-person shooter. You can see a direct progression from here to current blockbusters like the Call of Duty series. Chosen over Doom, Halo.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a>, Mac, 1993. Gorgeous graphics, a good story, and the freedom to set your own pace.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcraft">StarCraft</a>, Windows, 1998. Exceptional realtime strategy for both single players and network play. It&rsquo;s a professional sport, for chrissakes. Chosen over Command &amp; Conquer, World of WarCraft.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)">Pok&eacute;mon</a>, Game Boy, 1998. Spawned an empire, even before the versions where you could breed them.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_(video_game)">Guitar Hero</a>, PS2, 2005. When video games began to cross over into real life, both in the means of control but also in something relatable to everyone. Chosen over Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_birds">Angry Birds</a>, iOS, 2009. Surely this is the most important casual game of all time. There&rsquo;s a reason every modern platform (including the Internet) has a native version.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early arcade titles like Pong, Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Centipede. I&rsquo;ll just admit I&rsquo;m too young to understand how much of an impact these had when they were released.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game)">Oregon Trail</a>, Apple II, 1978. Important now because of the heavy nostalgia factor. Did anyone really learn history from this, or did we all just shoot buffalo?</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a> series. King&rsquo;s Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry are all legendary franchises (and collectively an important part of gaming history) but I don&rsquo;t know if one single game stands out. Chosen over Zork series, Rogue.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL">Madden NFL</a>. Again, another franchise that I think is incredibly relevant for its lasting success, but without a specific outstanding installment. Chosen over NBA Jam.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a>, Game Boy, 1989. There were no characters (except faceless Russians maybe) but it was still fun, challenging, and accessible.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>, PS2, 2001. The first mainstream scapegoat game for the corruption of our youth, and a revolution in the open sandbox world.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>, Wii, 2006. How many Wii owners never bought a game and just played the included title? Chosen over Mario Party series, anything for the Kinect.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rohrer#Games">Passage</a>, PC, 2007. Introduced dumb dumbs like me to the idea of video games as art.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you could only choose one, which would it be? <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=127473155882237952">Please tell me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Also tell me if I overlooked something, if I gave too much credence to one or not enough to another, or if you have any good jokes. This was mostly an exercise in curiosity and taking advantage of the savants who furiously edit Wikipedia articles about subjects so dear to their hearts.</p>

<title>Recharging on Wheels</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/recharging-on-wheels.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>&ldquo;Kicking is the most natural of human actions. Even unborn children kick.&rdquo; I read that in a soccer magazine when I was little and it stuck with me long after I stopped playing. Lupe Fiasco&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl83mI69nX4">breakout single</a> reduced skateboarding to &ldquo;kick, push, coast.&rdquo; Put both maxims together and you have cruising around on your board as a natural extension of human instinct.</p>
<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s how I see it. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;do any tricks. Get me out of the skatepark, and forget about any ollies. I just want to get on a board and head for some smooth asphalt. If the wind&rsquo;s at my back and the world&rsquo;s descending in front of me, I can cruise forever. No effort, no style, just me and my thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt comfortable alone. As one <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/2696/">popular essay</a> put it, alone time actually restores energy for some people (myself included&mdash;never had I thought &ldquo;This person GETS me&rdquo; until I read that). So I began to purposefully observe these solitary hours as recharge time, and often they entailed a ride around the neighborhood. A Prius recharges its batteries when you apply the brakes. I recharge mine when I cruise with abandon.</p>
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/skateboards.jpg" alt="Boards" class="center">
<p><strong>SIDEBAR:</strong> can I get a little MTV Cribs on you? I kind of see my two boards as cars. There&rsquo;s the everyday ride, like some kind of luxury sedan, and the warm-weather sports coupe. More technically: a 34" <a href="http://www.sector9.com">Sector 9</a> deck with the perfect amount of flex, 180mm Randal trucks and 68mm Avalon wheels; and then an 18" <a href="http://www.madridskateboards.com">Madrid</a> deck, tiny 77mm trucks and 71mm Madrid wheels. I don&rsquo;t know why the decks are imperial and the rest are metric. That&rsquo;s skateboarding for you &mdash; NO RULES!</p>
<p>Whether on my main board which can roll forever, or my tiny board which I can grab without a second thought, I can ride away any pent-up anxieties. Sometimes I listen to music, but that can turn into its own thing&mdash;when I bought an iPod shuffle in college, I stopped skating to class because I wanted to take the extra time to walk and listen. I never take my phone with me. If I&rsquo;m awake late at night or early in the morning, I&rsquo;ll find an empty street on a downhill and gently carve subtle back-and-forths for its entire length, over and over. It always works. I come back refreshed, clear, and calm.</p>
<p>There are other ways to recharge, of course. Sitting in bed or a comfy chair and getting lost in a story. Turning the music up loud and putting the player or the remote out of reach. Packing a backpack and going to Vegas for 48 hours (but no more). Seriously. They&rsquo;ve all worked for me. It&rsquo;s about steering your mind towards something outside your everyday life and letting it play there. For me, that will always be the simple pleasure of cruising on a skateboard.</p>

<title>A Tale of Two Laptops</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/two-laptops.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/two-laptops.jpg" alt="MacBook Air and iBook" class="center">
<h2>A G3 iBook</h2>
<p>Growing up, my family always had a Macintosh computer. This makes mine a pretty gifted childhood, especially for someone born in 1985. The Macintosh II, our family computer for a long time, easily cost more then five grand. Once we had a newer, faster Performa, I was able to spend uninterrupted hours dicking around in HyperCard and ResEdit on the II. I learned my way through every file in the System Folder for System 7.1, and almost every file&rsquo;s resource fork too.</p>
<p>After junior high, my parents bought an iMac (first generation, third revision, &ldquo;blueberry&rdquo;), and it made so much more possible. 32-bit icons with translucency! The Control Strip and Launcher! THE INTERNET!</p>
<p>It took me a while to transition to OS X, but once I got there I also transitioned my need for a computer. Playing MP3s and surfing the web overtook tinkering with the system interface or playing the same handful of Ambrosia games over again.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve had the itch to go back and recreate a Classic environment, to set it up just as I remember, the satisfaction of getting everything finally the way I wanted it through many frustrating Control Panels. Emulation solutions like Basilisk and SheepShaver haven&rsquo;t really cut it. So I bought one of the last Apple machines that natively booted into OS 9: a 500mHz G3 iBook (not the toilet seat kind).</p>
<p>The fastest Mac anyone in our family owned before the switch to OS X was that iMac, with a 333mHz G3. This iBook feels faster than that; any delays are obviously a product of the OS rather than overtaxed hardware. The battery lasts about four minutes. I knew this going into the purchase, and it doesn&rsquo;t bother me too much to leave it plugged in. The display is pretty crisp. OS 9 is way more pixelly than today&rsquo;s operating systems&mdash;lots of straight lines and right corners&mdash;and it all looks great.</p>
<p>The hard disk holds 15GB, and for a machine with zero music or movie files and an old operating system, this feels like an infinite amount. I&rsquo;ve ripped all the CDs of games I play as disk images and I still haven&rsquo;t filled it halfway. The iBook came with the optional AirPort (802.11b only!) card, but I think it&rsquo;s broken. No matter, because my choices are Netscape or Internet Explorer 5.</p>
<p>OS 9 itself shows its age and can be frustrating to use after so many years with OS X. For example, double clicking a folder in the Finder opens its own window. I remember finding this frustrating to change <em>from</em>, and changing <em>back</em> is even worse. Anxiety-inducing clutter!</p>
<p>The Launcher control panel is a necessity for anyone who uses the Dock regularly. The Control Strip is also still great: it&rsquo;s funny that features migrated from the lower-left corner here to the upper-right corner in the OS X menubar.</p>
<p>I have all the greats from Ambrosia installed, some newer classics like Oni and Deus Ex, and some older gems like Carmen Sandiego, Spin Doctor, Spectre, and Lode Runner. Of course, I also installed ResEdit and HyperCard to see what I remember. <a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/">The Macintosh Garden</a> has been an essential resource in taking this trip down memory lane.</p>
<h2>A MacBook Air</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve owned, in order, a first-revision 12" PowerBook G4, a first-revision white MacBook, and a first-revision 13" unibody MacBook. All of these were good computers but had serious shortcomings when compared to their second revisions. The PowerBook got USB 2 and DVI in addition to the usual speed bumps. The white MacBook went from a Core Duo to a Core 2 Duo &mdash; something Apple apparently cares about, judging by Lion&rsquo;s requirements. The unibody MacBook became a MacBook Pro, significantly increasing its battery life and gaining a Firewire port and SD slot.</p>
<p>I bought the unibody MacBook with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD from Apple, so it never felt slow. Most apps loaded in one Dock bounce or less. Beach balls were rare, but noticeable when doing something heavily reliant on Flash (the fan kicked in here too). This is a common thread in Mac reviews, and removing Flash is a common response, but I&rsquo;ll admit that I watch my fair share of Megavideo, Hulu and other web video, so I&rsquo;m dealing with it.</p>
<p>The only update to that model that ever bothered me was the bump in battery life. I don&rsquo;t play games or make graphics enough to care about the upgrade from a 9400m to a 320m, and I don&rsquo;t use my point-and-shoot enough that managing SD cards is a hassle. I do, however, spend more time away from my uncomfortable desk, and don&rsquo;t enjoy retreating back there to plug in and recharge. The weight of the MacBook has never bothered me, but after holding a MacBook Air, who wouldn&rsquo;t want the lighter machine?</p>
<p>Welp, Apple released the second revision <em>of</em> the second revision of the MacBook Air to coincide with Lion&rsquo;s release, and I&rsquo;ve moved up to a maxed-out 13-inch model. I keep a backlit keyboard (though it&rsquo;s new to this revision), I lose almost three pounds, and the battery life essentially doubles. Coming from an SSD, the day-to-day speed increase is not that noticeable. I probably get the same amount of beach balls. Tasks like encoding MP3s or scrolling through iPhoto are noticeably faster, though.</p>
<p>Really, the upgrade was worth it for this machine&rsquo;s <em>portability</em>. Most Air reviews I read include a phrase along the lines of &ldquo;even weeks later, I still find myself marvelling at how thin and light it is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s so thin in front that the rubber feet on the bottom seem to elevate it as high as it is thick. This makes it look like it&rsquo;s floating off the desk. The battery is fantastic, even with the i7. With WiFi on and the screen at a third-brightness, I get about eight hours of battery with light browsing. This is easily double the real-world performance of the old MacBook.</p>
<p>My first experience with Lion was on this new machine. This certainly supports the feeling that the OS was designed for this laptop especially. The 13" screen size seems like the upper bound at which full-screen apps make sense, and the trackpad&rsquo;s surface area is just right. As an OS, Lion generally feels very familiar. I don&rsquo;t use Expose, Dashboard, or now Mission Control (nor Launchpad), so there&rsquo;s no learning curve for those features. I&rsquo;m a fan of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; scrolling direction. It wasn&rsquo;t taxing to re-learn.</p>
<p>Versions is still confusing every once in a while. The Duplicate command essentially replaced Save As, right? All my old documents are Locked, but not in the Finder, but I can usually get a keystroke or two in before the system yells at me. It&rsquo;s not frustrating (yet), but not seamless either. The worst thing is TextEdit force-saving my HTML and other documents into plain text. I know there&rsquo;s an option for it not to, and I have it set. <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3279378">I&rsquo;m not the only one either</a>, I promise. <em>(Updated 10/25/11: 10.7.2 fixes this bug, and HTML saves as HTML again.)</em></p>
<p>This machine, so slight in its appearance, can do everything I need it to do and last a full day on one charge, and that is supremely satisfying.</p>

<title>What's in my Pockets</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/whats-in-my-pockets.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/theitemswecarry/pool/">The Items We Carry</a> group on Flickr used to be really captivating before members started adding promotional photos, multiple angles, or the full contents of their bags. At its beginning, each photo showed the few items its photographer carried in his or her pockets. I followed it for a long time because I definitely take some satisfaction in the constraint of limiting what I bring with me to what can fit in my pockets.</p>
<p>Every day, I am at least carrying my house key, my wallet, and my phone. The middle of these is the most dynamic; it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.koyono.com/ViewSlimmy-Thin-Front-Pocket-ID-Wallet-p/m17546w.htm">ViewSlimmy wallet</a> by Koyono that helped me pare down what I carry. It has four compartments: a clear one for my ID, one for cash, one for cards (only one credit and one debit), and one left over. When I go to work, the &ldquo;left over&rdquo; compartment houses my transit card. I used to carry a blank business card in my wallet as a space for notes, but building Pastecard has let me move that to my phone. Any receipts I might pick up during the day go in here too.</p>
<p>Monday through Friday, I also carry my company badge and its zip-up belt clip, and the key to my work laptop&rsquo;s security lock. At first, I thought of them as necessary evils, but &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is too strong a word. It still feels nice to dump these on my desk during the weekend, though.</p>
<h3>Update 8/23/11</h3>
<p>As I write this update, I&rsquo;m on the other side of the country as when I originally wrote the post. I&rsquo;m also not working. This means I don&rsquo;t carry my badge, laptop key, or transit card anymore, but I also find myself in a completely different state of mind. In San Francisco, I was intrigued by products or services that could consolidate everything I needed to carry onto my phone. For example, <a href="https://squareup.com/cardcase">Square Card Case</a> could replace my wallet and <a href="https://lockitron.com/less">Lockitron</a> could replace my keys. This would be the greatest, since I&rsquo;m carrying my phone around with me all the time anyways.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m living a beach bum lifestyle and suddenly there&rsquo;s no desire to have my phone on me all the time anymore. I&rsquo;m more interested now in the simplest way to carry around my house keys, and sometimes a book or a little cash. There&rsquo;s nothing to buy at the beach, and I don&rsquo;t want to check anything on the Internet while I&rsquo;m there. I currently have a keyring attached to a bungie that I can wrap around my wrist (for pocket-less swimsuits), but suggestions are welcome. These lighter pockets feel even better.</p>

<title>My iPhone Home Screen</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/iphone-homescreen.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p><img src="https://bsuto.com/articles/homescreen.png" alt="homescreen" class="right">You can tell a lot about a person by what they choose to have on their homescreen, and a lot of people seem to <a href="http://www.firstand20.com">enjoy</a> these introspections. Here&rsquo;s a play-by-play of the homescreen on my iPhone 4 (GSM, black, 32GB). The top four apps are easily the ones I use the most.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/download/iphone">Twitter</a> &mdash; Purchased as Tweetie 2, stayed with it since. iOS 4 with multitasking killed its List support, though. My theory is that since apps no longer fully quit, the table of tweets from a List remains in cache. Pulling to refresh on a List inserts the 20 most recent tweets on top of the last tweets you viewed (even if days ago), but doesn&rsquo;t render the &ldquo;accordion&rdquo; between them, removing the opportunity to fill in any tweets that were posted inbetween. Otherwise, great.</p>
<p><a href="http://reederapp.com/2/">Reeder</a> &mdash; Nice design, with quirks that aren&rsquo;t obnoxious. I set the preference to cache all starred items, which are fun to review every once in a while (and this way, I don&rsquo;t have to wait for the media to load). The list of sharing options is impressive, and equally impressive that it&rsquo;s so granularly controlled. I have Instapaper, Instapaper Mobilizer, Copy Link, and Send to Safari enabled.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> &mdash; Easily the app where I spend the most time. The whole service is incredible; I paid $10 for the Pro app when it was first released and am happy to have done so. My only feature request is to be able to edit the titles of saved articles directly in the app rather than through the web interface. I obsessively strip site names and other unnecessary words from article tites.</p>
<p><a href="http://pastecard.net/">Pastecard</a> &mdash; I&rsquo;ve written more about why I use Pastecard <a href="https://bsuto.com/articles/why-pastecard.html">elsewhere</a>. I probably launch this app around 20 times a day.</p>
<p>Camera &mdash; The iPhone 4&rsquo;s camera is great and slowly replacing my point-and-shoot. I tend to dump all the photos to my computer every time I sync, only keeping the ones I want to post on Twitter (and then deleting them after).</p>
<p>Settings &mdash; I keep as many antennas off as possible to conserve battery, and it&rsquo;s useful to have this up front when I need to toggle one back on. Out of the apps I use, only Reeder puts its settings in the Settings app.</p>
<p>Phone &mdash; The iPhone is a phone, but I don&rsquo;t like making or receiving calls. I will say that I don&rsquo;t remember what voicemail was like before iPhones, so that at least is nice.</p>
<p>Messages &mdash; I use text messages way more than I thought I would.</p>
<p>Safari &mdash; Other than editing Instapaper entries, mostly used for Google and Wikipedia searches. I know it&rsquo;s possible to also do this by swiping left into Spotlight, but that ends up launching Safari anyways, so I don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>iPod &mdash; The reason I bought a 32GB iPhone was to fully replace any need for an iPod. My entire music library is on here with plenty of free space remaining.</p>
<p>The background is a photo I took from a house in Sea Ranch, CA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equally informative what isn&rsquo;t on my homescreen. I have the Mail app set up to my personal Gmail account, but I barely use it. I feel the same way about email as I do about phone calls. For text-based communication, I prefer text messages and Twitter. Most of the built-in apps, from the two stores to widgets like Stocks and Weather, are grouped together in a folder called &ldquo;Trash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the phone is set to Edge instead of 3G. This lets me use the phone pretty heavily for two full days before recharging, and the speed is plenty fast. Of course, the four apps I use most primarily retrieve text off the Internet, rather than images or video.</p>

<title>What Apple could do with the iPod shuffle</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/ipod-shuffle.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The first iPod shuffle was still an iPod; more of a device&mdash;a gadget&mdash;than an accessory. Sure, it had a secondary cap that was attached to a lanyard, but I only used that once and rarely saw it on anyone else. When you unplugged the headphones, the iPod was a rectangle of iconic white. It had a button on the back with an LED whose color denoted remaining battery life. It was the very tangible size of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050203180707/http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">a pack of gum</a>. It was even reviewed to put out the highest-quality audio of the iPod line at the time.</p>
<p>In three successive generations, the shuffle has gotten smaller and more wearable. Its target market is clearly those who exercise to music, not those who just want a small MP3 player. As a member of this second group of people, the shuffle is another example of a satisfying constraint. When I owned the first-generation shuffle, it was paired with a 20GB fourth-generation iPod. The latter had my entire music library (with half of its capacity to spare), where any song was accessible on a whim after much circle-scrolling. The 512MB (!) shuffle, on the other hand, was perfect for containing the most recent songs I&rsquo;d downloaded and wanted to listen to, along with a couple favorites. In iTunes, I organized the shuffle&rsquo;s only playlist by date added, so when the shuffle was engaged in non-random order, hitting Play queued up my newest song. It was easy and dependable for something based on randomness.</p>
<p>When the iPod nano came out and offered a mix of the capacity of the larger iPods with the portability and durability of the shuffle, I sold both in favor of a nano. Six years later, Apple has released a fourth-generation shuffle that is hardly bigger than its control pad. The constraint of a small, dedicated music device is still appealing to me&mdash;even though the current shuffle has the same 2GB capacity as the nano I owned&mdash;but I think Apple has an opportunity to further specialize it.</p>
<p>Instead of a dedicated battery life button, the current shuffle has a dedicated button to trigger its VoiceOver mode, which is not as useful given the controls on its face. The current nano, which is honestly not much bigger, can be used with the Nike+ program once you attach an adapter to its dock connector. The iPod touch and iPhone both have the sensor from this receiver built in. As Apple has demonstrated, high technology and adequate battery life can be maintained while reducing size. If they still have some magic to exercise, why not build Nike+ technology or at least a pedometer into the shuffle?</p>
<p>There are many difficulties, I know.</p>
<ol>
<li>Control: it would be unclear how to operate the function. Apple has the VoiceOver feature already built in to return feedback to the user, and my off-the-cuff suggestion is to use the dedicated VoiceOver button to instead toggle Nike+ functionality (more an on/off switch than a single button). How to initially configure it and synchronize it to the shoe transmitter is a tough problem.</li>
<li>Feedback: how do you track your progress without a screen? Perhaps more iTunes software that reads data from an exercise session and presents it in a tab of the shuffle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Device&rdquo; screen. We know Apple&rsquo;s not above tacking features onto iTunes. Maybe they would even allow you to share your results via Ping.</li>
<li>Size: it could very well be impossible to fit more hardware into the shuffle, even with optimizations to its current technology. And even if you could, it&rsquo;s another drain on the battery, which itself doesn&rsquo;t have room to grow.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stretch. But if Apple builds exercise features into its clearly exercise-focused iPod shuffle and maintains its size, functionality, and battery life, they&rsquo;ll have a buyer in me.</p>

<title>Feature Phones</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/feature-phones.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>For most of college, my phone was a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/samsung-sgh-x495-t-mobile/specs/">Samsung x495</a> on a pay-as-you-go T-Mobile plan. This little phone was was everything I needed at the time and nothing more. I once dropped it out of a second story window and watched it bounce off the asphalt parking lot below. It picked up some scuffs, but continued to function normally until I upgraded (by choice) to another phone. Its battery life would last for days &mdash; seriously, like an entire workweek. It got great reception, and people never complained about the call quality. My text message usage was low enough that the keypad-style of entering letters never bothered me, nor ate up my prepaid minutes.</p>
<p>This Samsung and a first generation 512MB iPod shuffle were once the only gadgets brought along on a long-weekend vacation, and I remember finding these constraints refreshing. I had my favorite songs with me on a device that was easy to take anywhere, and a phone that&mdash;whether for financial concern or otherwise&mdash;I never felt compelled to check or answer. I discovered on that trip that the pathetic TZones WAP internet service, through some loophole, was provided for free and I could actually get news headlines and sports scores from anywhere there was a GPRS signal. This in itself was a restraint because one was limited to the few content providers T-Mobile had selected, but I remember the aha moment where I realized that I could easily get lost in having the Internet anywhere I was.</p>
<p>Today, I have an iPhone 4, which does way more than that little Samsung and holds much more music than that iPod shuffle. I read Twitter and RSS feeds and saved articles wherever I am (obligatory asterisk to a smarmy footnote about AT&amp;T reception). I have playlists and every MP3 I own stored on it, so I can  either listen to my favorites as usual or pull up a specific song on demand. It has a camera that compares with the 3MP point-and-shoot I owned at the same time as my old phone. Even with all this usage, its battery still lasts about two days, which is more than satisfactory to me. On top of it all, the user experience (led by the crisp display) is perfect. My expectations and requirements for mobile devices have changed, and this again is the device that provides everything I need right now (but probably a little more too).</p>
<p>Though sometimes I wonder what it would be like to disconnect in a way and go back to that simple flip-phone with barely a data plan and a separate music player with no display and limited storage, and whether the constraints would be refreshing again, or frustrating.</p>

<title>Why Pastecard</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/why-pastecard.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Over four years ago, inspired by the (nano) <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">Hipster PDA</a>, I started carrying a blank business card in my wallet so I would always have something to write on. There are no limitations to a blank piece of paper other than its size &mdash; it can be used to write down reminders, driving directions, lists, ideas, to-dos, jokes, more. Even before I owned an iPhone, I realized that having a digital version of this would be useful. There were already dozens of GTD apps and task managers that required you to enter data in certain formats and under certain UIs. I just wanted a digital blank piece of paper that functioned equally on my desktop and my phone.</p>
<h2>The UI</h2>
<p>To access Pastecard, you just navigate to the URL where you installed it. There&rsquo;s no authentication step of any kind. When the page finishes loading, it&rsquo;s just a rectangle of plain text. There are no buttons or images. Clicking or tapping on the box makes it editable and reveals two buttons to save changes or cancel out, and both those actions bring the window back to its original state. I essentially wanted no UI, nothing to get in the way of reading and editing.</p>
<h2>The Simplicity</h2>
<p><a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a>&rsquo;s explosive popularity started after I had been using Pastecard on an iPhone. I bought it and used it for a while, and actually really liked it. The most immediate advantage was the ability to use it without an Internet connection, something that was impossible with a web app (and likely to remain impossible by choice, despite cache manifests and HTML5 local databases).</p>
<p>But after a couple months, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t need the ability to store multiple notes or the ability to search through them, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t enjoy logging in from each new desktop browser I used. So I went back and rewrote Pastecard to reduce its filesize and make it load faster, even over anemic cellular data connections. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: Simplenote is great and is only getting greater, but it turns out I wanted <em>Simpler</em>note.</p>
<h2>The Security</h2>
<p>The only thing preventing someone from hijacking my Pastecard is that they don&rsquo;t know its URL. This is true to life; the only thing preventing someone from scribbling over my blank business card is that they don&rsquo;t know where it is. In either case, if someone else has access, they&rsquo;re free to edit as they want, and I am fine with this. The kind of information that I put there isn&rsquo;t sensitive or of dire importance. If it was, I could just remember it (I hope).</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shared Pastecard with a couple friends and posted the source code on my personal site for everyone to use. I&rsquo;ve thought about offering it as a complete package (pastecardapp.com/username maybe) &mdash; for free, of course, and still without any authentication. I may attempt to rewrite the web app to function offline somehow. No matter what happens, I will make sure Pastecard stays true to its roots of a digital scrap of paper.</p>
<h2>Update 10/30/10: Going Public</h2>
<p>Pastecard is now a publicly-available product. While I still provide the source for download at the site, people may now register a username and host their personal card at <a href="http://pastecard.net">pastecard.net</a>. I have migrated my personal card there and those of two of my friends, the site&rsquo;s first three users. Just as with the product, the site itself is simple, with only a home page, a signup form, a help page, and the download page. I&rsquo;m choosing not to promote it for now, and to see how it spreads via word of mouth.</p>
<p>The product&rsquo;s light footprint makes it relatively cheap and easy to serve. I&rsquo;m using a shared server with <a href="http://www.asmallorange.com/">A Small Orange</a>, and their least-expensive plan at that. Assuming my hosting load and bandwidth do not exceed the plan&rsquo;s offerings (more on this in a bit), the total cost of running the site will be $35 a year, including the domain. The increased speed combined with the satisfaction of maintaining a complete product is worth the cost to me. No need to run ads or otherwise recoup this cost.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the site&rsquo;s assets take up about 56K of space. Each individual user takes up no more than 2K, depending on how much text they&rsquo;re storing at any given time. Going by my own usage, each user will access their card 20 times a day on average, resulting in roughly 160K of bandwidth (excluding any visits to the main site). I manage the site using Google&rsquo;s free apps for domains, specifically Gmail and Documents. Pastecard should scale very well with its estimated usage.</p>
<h2>Update 6/8/11: The Cloud</h2>
<p>Pastecard hasn&rsquo;t gotten many more users since the last update, but cloud storage is going to receive a lot of attention soon, now that Apple&rsquo;s put an i in front of it. Pastecard has always worked like a cloud app, thanks to being entirely on the web. Being able to &ldquo;install&rdquo; the web app to your phone can make it seem more like a native app, but it&rsquo;s always been &ldquo;cloud-powered.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t expect cloud mania to drive more people to Pastecard, but the cloud&rsquo;s growing popularity reassures me that the choice to build for the web was the right one.</p>
<p>Just as Apple&rsquo;s solution makes the cloud the primary hub, rather than a desktop computer, so is the same with Pastecard. It&rsquo;s what keeps it simple. And, despite what I wrote above, the iOS home screen version of Pastecard can now store data locally so it can open without a data connection. Keeping with the cloud-centric philosophy, the end device is still only a consumer from the cloud. Offline mode cannot make edits that are published later; it&rsquo;s just read-only until you can get back online.</p>

<title>What About The iPhone?</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/what-about-the-iphone.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I have not played with an iPad yet, just observed some from afar and read the many reviews and reactions. A lot of these reactions talk about its magical battery life and how it&rsquo;s a great all-day, on-the-go computer. Other reviews marvel at its abstraction of the filesystem, the user experience of the touch interface, and so on. While at Chirp, the Twitter developer conference, I saw a lot of iPads. The perfect conference computer, right? Power, battery life, and a big screen for sharing.</p>
<p>I do not have an iPad, but I have a computer with all of those features (save the big screen): an iPhone 3GS. Have we forgotten how &ldquo;magical&rdquo; this thing is? I used it as my only computer at Chirp, for email, tweets, and web browsing. I was also able to take pictures, stay connected to the Internet via 3G, and send text messages, all things that the (currently WiFi-only) iPads could not do. When the WiFi networks acted up, I was still going (albeit slowly). When something urgent came up, I was able to send a text message or make a call. And when someone came up to talk to me, I put my iPhone in my pocket and was able to shake hands. I didn&rsquo;t have to fumble a large device, put it down, or awkwardly tuck it under an arm. And the battery lasted all day, admittedly in some part due to my turning 3G off in the final hour.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practically a given at this point that Apple will announce a new iPhone this summer, likely in late June. It could have a higher-resolution screen, a better camera, a second camera, the A4, improved battery life, an aluminum unibody construction (but if so, please not at the expense of reception), and a microwave. I&rsquo;ll upgrade soon after it comes out, once the reviews are in. Partly because I&rsquo;m a sucker, but also because I still think this thing is magical. It&rsquo;s got most of what makes the iPad so special, and it fits in my pocket.</p>

<title>My Top 10 Songs of the Decade</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/top-ten-songs-2000s.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Hopefully this list is different from the ones you&rsquo;re used to, because I&rsquo;m musically-ignorant and didn&rsquo;t give pop, hip hop, or obscure indie tracks a fair shake.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGB2DLbM9AU">The New Year</a> - Death Cab for Cutie (2003)</h2>
<p>This was a gateway drug to the band for me. The studio cut layers modern-rock overdrive with alternative echo-effected progressions. Live, they play it hard and scare all the soft-rock enthusiasts who heard Soul Meets Body on adult contemporary back into their Priuses. Bonus: if you listen to Transatlanticism on repeat, the noise at the end of A Lack of Color blends into the beginning of The New Year, which is a nice touch.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUInPeqZ9Q">The Fight</a> - Days Away (2005)</h2>
<p>The entire album was incredible, so I picked The Fight as a mix between my other favorites, Stay the Same (for its echo-y slow melodies) and Ideas (for the quicker beat and more crunchy chords). The ba-ba-ba chorus backing is great, and the strained-relationship lyrics aren&rsquo;t too dumb. I was also debating putting Good Old War on this list, but both bands shared members so I&rsquo;ll count this as their honorable mention.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJh4a1TNdJs">It&rsquo;s Far Better To Learn</a> - Saosin (2006)</h2>
<p>Not much to say, I&rsquo;ll let the lead guitar and drum work speak for themselves. Cove&rsquo;s vocals are killer. This song pumps me up.</p>
<h2>7. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwgu2qFrOEE">Pachuca Sunrise</a> - Minus the Bear (2005)</h2>
<p>Never mind that all three versions of this song released this decade rocked for their own reasons. The video is gorgeous, the riff is astounding, and the beat is catchy. By far the best part is how the ending slowly unravels from the chorus and fades away, each component of the song dropping out on its own.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAVDHo1Elc">12:51</a> - The Strokes (2003)</h2>
<p>Sure, the power chords are easy and the progression is simple, but this song shows how The Strokes are together greater than the sum of their parts. Quick guitar lines during the verses, the bass beat, and the palm-muted rhythm chords all mesh together into sonic harmony. The chorus, with its saccharine riff layered over rapid-fire shredding (effected so it coos like a synth), staccato drumming, and handclaps is just golden.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOJbh7hYn8c">Am I Wry? No</a> - Mew (2003)</h2>
<p>The way it builds from the beginning to 1:25 is impressive. The breakdown that comes out of nowhere at 3:09 is awesome.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIu7RdV3zZg">Governor</a> - Cassino (2007)</h2>
<p>If Jack Johnson traded his boardshorts for some flannel, I think he would sound like Cassino. This is easy mellow music done right; it builds slowly with percussion and choral backup. When performed live, the band adds a harmonica to this tune, and I hope to experience that in the next decade.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHb_XIql_gU">Kids</a> - MGMT (2008)</h2>
<p>So what if it&rsquo;s currently overplayed. Touches like the trumpet fanfare at the end of the bridge and simple loud beat make it a replayable classic. Hearing the hook slide back in under the chorus just feels right, each time it happens.</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6sCyxDz0Hg">After Hours</a> - We Are Scientists (2008)</h2>
<p>Check out the acoustic backings in the intro and the end of the bridge, the two-note harmonics before each chorus, intermittent chimes, or even the subtle string section at the end. This is of course in addition to the bass line that alternates between melodic and driving, and the quick riff / uptempo drum beat combo. Why aren&rsquo;t they bigger?</p>    
<h2>1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl8mC_UOmg">Q&amp;A</a> - Cartel (2005)</h2>
<p>Over ten minutes of experimental pop punk, and although it&rsquo;s two tracks on the album, I count it as one song. It knocks you out if you&rsquo;ve listened to the album in order, because it recycles lyrics and melodies from previous songs while sounding new. Will Pugh&rsquo;s voice is stellar, even when it&rsquo;s auto-tuned at the end. I spent more time listening to this song than any other song this decade.</p>

<title>Ode to TextEdit</title>
<link>https://bsuto.com/articles/ode-to-textedit.html</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;m by no means an expert at any real programming languages. But I&rsquo;ve been playing around with HTML and CSS for years, and always feel the most comfortable writing the related code out by hand in plain text. There are many specialized text editors out there, and I&rsquo;ve tried a couple (from the Source mode of <a href="http://lowendmac.com/musings/06/art0830/claris_home_page_whole.gif">Claris Home Page</a> on the old family computer, to vi in the terminal, to Coda), but I always go back to the simple text editor bundled with my Mac.</p>
<p>I remember keeping a copy of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090627104502/http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1005.html">SimpleText</a> on the floppy disk I had in grade school, so I could edit my homework in a familiar writing environment. Writing assignments were much simpler back then &ndash; no need for fancy fonts or formatting. Eventually, I started using Microsoft Word for documents that needed rich text, but kept SimpleText around for all my web work. I even kept a copy of SimpleText on my first college laptop and booted into Classic just to run it.</p>
<p>I knew about TextEdit in OS X, and how it was SimpleText&rsquo;s successor, but I was initially turned off by its default setup with rulers and rich text. Once I figured out how to optimize it for plain text by default, I switched to it for almost everything. Today, I do all my web work, track my to-dos and lists (option-8: learn it, love it), and draft correspondences and ideas in TextEdit. I have folders and folders of plain text documents on my computer, and even built my first web app around a plain text file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not preaching the virtues of a simple text editor like TextEdit to everyone. For me, it&rsquo;s exactly what I need: more GUI than a terminal window, but nothing extra; instantaneous load time from double-click to new document; spell-checking when I want it, and stability (it even autosaves in Leopard). For people who work closer with code, syntax highlighting and more powerful tools are of course necessary. But the bundled plain text editor will always be enough for me.</p>

<title>The Birthday Party Log of Ned, Born On February 29</title>
<link>https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-birthday-party-log-of-ned-born-on-february-29</link>
<category>Article</category>
<description><![CDATA[
<h2>1 Year Old</h2>
<p>The theme of the party is dancing around to <em>Sesame Street</em> cassettes. None of my guests even go so far as to stand up; most opt to nap the whole time. One vomits on his mother. I hope it was not the result of an undercooked cake.</p>
<h2>2 Years Old</h2>
<p>Hire a Power Ranger to facilitate the proceedings. Guests instead clamor for SpongeBob SquarePants. The G.I. Joe party favors are nearly swallowed, yet the cake is thrown on the ground when guests are told it is time to go home.</p>
<h2>8 Years Old</h2>
<p>Notable fact: I am at least twice as big as any of my guests this year. Also, I am the only one who is married.</p>
<h2>17 Years Old</h2>
<p>Went and saw my first R-rated movie, as is the custom for all 17-year-olds. My friends were laughing at the antics of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, but the dialogue was too fast-paced for me. The preview for Clint Eastwood&#8217;s film looked interesting.</p>
<h2>18 Years Old</h2>
<p>So many freedoms! Registered to vote; will only actually do so if the home provides a ride come November. Purchased one cigar; will display on bureau for years to come. Bought pornography with high-school buddies; later thrown away due to impotence.</p>
<h2>21 Years Old</h2>
<p>Am told the tradition involves imbibing 21 drinks of my choice. Opt instead for a glass of gin and the blue-light special. In bed by 7 p.m.</p>
<h2>25 Years Old</h2>
<p>Upon waking up, notice that my face looks as if I had just stepped out of a wind tunnel. Disappointed that all my peers have such tight skin. When I step into the living room, everyone applauds my arrival, as if it were a huge accomplishment. This makes me feel better.</p>
<h2>26 Years Old</h2>
<p>Hearing my grandchildren shout &#8220;Surprise!&#8221; leads to fatal heart attack.</p>

<title>Bananas and Cheese</title>

<p>When I was too young to be dropped off at school so my mom could catch up on her soaps, she compromised with me by letting me catch up on my Mister Rogers&rsquo; Neighborhood for a half hour right before lunchtime. The venerable Fred Rogers played with puppets well into an age where he was eligible for AARP benefits, and also had a traffic light installed in his house. Needless to say, everything he told me should have been taken with a grain of salt, especially before lunchtime.</p>
<p>One day, Mr. McFeely (&ldquo;Speedy delivery!&rdquo;) brought Fred a blank gray box from the neighborhood grocer, known to all of us as Chef Brockett. Inside that box was one banana, one slice of pre-wrapped American cheese, and a note reading &ldquo;Wrap cheese around peeled banana and eat right away. Yours, C.B.&rdquo; This being a happier time, Fred gave no second thought to the sparse instructions before enjoying his snack. I immediately told my mother to nix the scheduled peanut butter and jelly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about this quick concoction (a &ldquo;C.B.&rdquo;&mdash;cheese banana, yes, but also Chef Brockett!), but it doesn&rsquo;t taste half bad. I&rsquo;ve tried it with Swiss and jack cheeses in addition to the classic American, and they all play nicely off the banana&rsquo;s spongy texture and unique flavor. I&rsquo;m sure there are health benefits galore, along with the added bonus of disgusted looks from your lunchtime companions.</p>
